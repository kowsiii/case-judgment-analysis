itself O
freely O
spoke O
of O
`` O

in O
its O
letter O
to O

dated O
10 O
April O
2002 O
. O
By O
that O

would O

possibility O
of O
litigation O
arising O
from O
its O
provision O

. O
That O
SCV O
nonetheless O
referred O
to O
its O
own O
conduct O
as O
`` O

indicated O
that O
it O
could O

The O
decision O
at O

12 O
At O
the O
trial O
, O
SCV S-RESPONDENT

advanced O
several O
lines O

Those O
which O
are O
relevant O
to O
this O
appeal O
are O
the O
following O
. O
13 O
First O
, O
SCV S-RESPONDENT

submitted O
that O
the O
NLA O
, O
on O
its O
true O
construction O
, O
did O
not O
contain O
any O
express O
or O
implied O
prohibition O
on O

. O
14 O
Second O
, O
SCV S-RESPONDENT

invoked O
the O
doctrine O
of O
estoppel O
by O
convention O
to O
preclude O
SingTel S-PETITIONER

from O
challenging O
the O
tapping O
which O
was O
carried O
out O
, O
claiming O
that O
the O
parties O

dealings O
rested O
on O
two O
underlying O
common O
assumptions O
. O
The O
first O
related O
to O
the O
charges O
which O
SCV S-RESPONDENT

was O
to O
pay O
under O
the O
envisaged O
lease O
of O
the O
Facilities O
in O
respect O
of O
Excluded O

SCV S-RESPONDENT

alleged O

the O

Third O
, O
SCV S-RESPONDENT

argued O
that O

by O

were O
irrecoverable O

Fourth O
, O

The O

dismissed O
all O

the O

of O
the O

He O
held O
that O

, O
although O

, O

This O
was O

With O

to O
the O

when O

He O

the O

letter O
dated O
17 O
July O
1996 O

Commercial O

apply O

Thus O
, O
when O
SCV S-RESPONDENT

used O
the O
Facilities O
to O
provide O
cable O

to O
such O
properties O
, O
it O

The O
trial O

noted O
that O

SingTel S-PETITIONER

was O
not O
charging O
SCV O
purely O
on O
a O

would O

without O

In O
the O
trial O

that O

as O

anything O

an O

description O

Subject O

the O

that O
it O

the O
exception O

absolutely O
anything O
which O

affected O
the O

by O

( O

The O

the O
previous O

their O
declarations O

The O

this O
distinction O
for O
reasons O
of O
practical O
policy O
and O
, O
in O
this O
respect O
only O
, O
legal O
interpretation O
differs O
from O
the O
way O
we O
would O
interpret O

in O
ordinary O
life O
. O
The O
boundaries O
of O
this O
exception O
are O
in O
some O
respects O
unclear O

this O
is O

the O

The O

which O
a O
document O
( O

any O

would O
convey O
to O
a O

man O
is O
not O
the O
same O
thing O
as O
the O
meaning O
of O
its O
words O
. O
The O
meaning O
of O
words O
is O
a O
matter O
of O
dictionaries O
and O
grammars O
; O
the O
meaning O
of O
a O
document O
is O
what O
the O
parties O
using O
those O
words O
against O
the O
relevant O
background O
would O
reasonably O
have O
been O
understood O
to O
mean O
. O
The O
background O
may O
not O
merely O
enable O
the O
reasonable O
man O
to O
choose O
between O
the O
possible O
meaning O
of O
words O
which O
are O
ambiguous O
but O
even O
( O
as O
occasionally O
happens O
in O
ordinary O
life O
) O
to O
conclude O
that O
the O
parties O
must O
, O
for O
whatever O
reason O
, O
have O
used O
the O
wrong O
words O
or O
syntax O

The O
`` O
rule O
'' O
that O
words O
should O
be O
given O
their O
`` O
natural O
and O
ordinary O
meaning O
'' O
reflects O
the O
common O
sense O
proposition O
that O
we O
do O
not O
easily O
accept O
that O
people O
have O
made O
linguistic O
mistakes O
, O
particularly O
in O
formal O
documents O

nevertheless O
conclude O
from O
the O
background O
that O
something O
must O
have O
gone O
wrong O
with O
the O
language O
, O
the O
law O
does O
not O
require O
judges O
to O
attribute O
to O
the O

an O

In O

, O
if O

that O

had O
throughout O
assumed O
that O

this O

In O

that O

for O

A O
subsidiary O
argument O

that O

said O
at O

: O
What O
does O
one O
mean O
by O
`` O

'' O
? O
Direct O
damage O
is O
that O
which O
flows O
naturally O
from O
the O
breach O
without O
other O
intervening O
cause O
and O
independently O
of O
special O
circumstances O

indirect O
damage O
does O
not O
so O
flow O
. O
The O
breach O
certainly O
has O
brought O
it O
about O
, O
but O
only O
because O
of O
some O
supervening O
event O
or O
some O
special O
circumstances O
. O
... O
In O
my O
judgment O
, O
the O
words O
`` O
indirect O
or O

do O
not O
exclude O
liability O
for O
damages O
which O
are O

Mr B-LAWYER

raises O
many O
arguments O
to O
challenge O
the O
Judge O

findings O
. O
I O
find O
two O
of O
the O
arguments O
particularly O
troubling O
not O
just O
because O
they O
were O
not O
raised O
during O
the O
trial O

also O
because O
they O
allege O
serious O
impropriety O
against O
the O
prosecution O
witnesses O
, O
their O
two O
employers O
, O
and O
the O
Shipyard O
without O
having O
put O
these O
allegations O
to O
them O
and O
without O
any O
evidential O
foundation O
. O
5 O
First O
, O
in O
his O
zeal O
to O
advance O
the O
Appellant O
's O
best O
case O
, O
Mr B-LAWYER

Balchandani E-LAWYER

alleges O
that O
the O
prosecution O
witnesses O
had O
colluded O
with O
each O
other O
to O
provide O
false O
testimony O
to O
wrongly O
implicate O
the O
Appellant O
, O
an O
innocent O
man O
. O
His O
submission O
went O
so O
far O
as O
to O
suggest O
that O
the O
collusion O
involved O
the B-ORG

Shipyard I-ORG
, E-ORG

Wee B-ORG

, E-ORG

and O
another O
sub-contractor O
, O
OUS O
Pte O

( O

. O
Not O
only O
was O
this O
collusion O
theory O
not O
formally O
put O
to O
the O
witnesses O
during O
the O
trial O
, O
there O
is O
simply O
no O
evidential O
basis O
for O
such O
serious O
allegations O
to O
be O
made O
in O
the O
first O
place O
. O
The O
second O
argument O
which O
troubles O
me O
concerns O
some O
videos O
and O
photographs O
( O
Exhibits O
D3 O
to O
D8 O
- O
collectively O
, O
`` O
the O
Exhibits O
'' O
) O
which O
the O
IO O
received O
from O
the O
Shipyard O
and O
which O
were O
brought O
to O
the O
attention O
of O
the O
Judge O
just O
before O
the O
close O
of O
the O
Prosecution O
's O
case O
. O
Their O
existence O
emerged O
in O
the O
course O
of O
the O
IO O
's O
cross-examination O
. O
The O
Prosecution O
explained O
that O
it O
was O
not O
relying O
on O
the O
Exhibits O
as O
it O
took O
the O
position O
that O
the O
Exhibits O
were O
at O
best O
neutral O
to O
the O
two O
charges O
. O
The O
Judge O
nevertheless O
gave O
the O
Appellant O
sufficient O
time O
to O
consider O
the O
Exhibits O
and O
thereafter O
allowed O
him O
to O
recall O
several O
witnesses O
following O
an O
interval O
of O
some O
four O
months O
. O
Despite O
Mr B-LAWYER

Balchandani I-LAWYER
's E-LAWYER

submission O
that O
the O
Exhibits O
, O
in O
particular O
the O
videos O
, O
were O
exculpatory O
of O
the O
Appellant O
, O
the O
Judge O
found O
that O
the O
Exhibits O
did O
not O
assist O
the O
Appellant O
but O
instead O
undermined O
the O
Appellant O
's O
defence O
( O
see O
the O
GD O
at O
[ O
83 O
] O
) O
. O
What O
is O
especially O
disturbing O
is O
that O
for O
this O
appeal O
, O
without O
any O
factual O
or O
expert O
evidence O
, O
Mr B-LAWYER

Balchandani E-LAWYER

maintains O
the O
same O
submission O
he O
made O
before O
the O
court O
below O
that O
it O
is O
`` O
plausible O
'' O
that O
the O
videos O
had O
been O
tampered O
with O
or O
at O
least O
edited O
by O
the O
Shipyard O
. O
The O
very O
nature O
of O
such O
an O
allegation O
cries O
out O
for O
substantiation O
. O
Yet O
this O
was O
not O
even O
put O
to O
any O
witness O
in O
the O
court O
below O
. O
Mr B-LAWYER

Balchandani E-LAWYER

claims O
on O
appeal O
, O
as O
he O
did O
below O
, O
that O
he O
only O
realised O
the O
possibility O
of O
the O
videos O
having O
been O
edited O
while O
he O
was O
preparing O
his O
closing O
submissions O
for O
the O
trial O
. O
His O
belated O
personal O
assessment O
of O
the O
videos O
offers O
no O
excuse O
for O
his O
misconceived O
pursuit O
of O
such O
a O
serious O
allegation O
without O
any O
independent O
factual O
foundation O
. O
6 O
While O
it O
is O
the O
duty O
of O
every O
counsel O
to O
put O
forward O
all O
available O
arguments O
in O
the O
best O
interest O
of O
his O
client O
, O
it O
is O
equally O
important O
for O
counsel O
to O
recognise O
his O
overarching O
duty O
as O
an O

The O
balancing O
of O
these O

duties O
requires O
counsel O
to O
make O
submissions O
in O
a O
responsible O
manner O
. O
This O
is O
especially O
so O
if O
the O
submission O
suggests O
either O
impropriety O
( O

never O

without O
any O

The O
most O
crucial O
witness O
was O
Safikul B-WITNESS

. E-WITNESS

He O
witnessed O
the O
Appellant O
feigning O
the O
fall O
. O
Safikul S-WITNESS

testified O
that O
he O
saw O
the O
Appellant O
bend O
down O

move O
towards O
the O

After O
that O
, O
the O
Appellant O
sat O
down O

laid O
down O
on O
the O
floor O
next O
to O
the O
ladder O
and O
then O
shouted O
that O
he O
had O
fallen O
from O

It O
follows O
from O
Safikul B-WITNESS

's E-WITNESS

evidence O
that O
the O
Appellant O
did O
not O
fall O
while O
climbing O
up O
the O

. O
Safikul S-WITNESS

testified O
that O
he O
was O
observing O
the O
Appellant O
because O
he O
was O
concerned O
that O
the O
Appellant O
might O
enter O
the O
area O
where O
lifting O
operations O
were O
taking O
place O
under O
his O
supervision O
. O
11 O
I O
note O
that O
Safikul S-WITNESS

was O
in O
close O
proximity O
to O
the O

throughout O
the O
entire O
incident O
. O
He O
was O
only O
approximately O
three O

four O

a O
half O

away O

. O
He O
had O
a O

line O

the O

walked O
to O
the O
location O
of O

his O
body O
bent O

In O
my O
view O

not O
assist O
the O
Appellant O

On O
the O
contrary O

it O
confirms O
Safikul B-WITNESS

evidence O
that O
the O
Appellant O

to O
bend O
down O

he O
could O
lie O
down O

ground O
next O
to O
the O
ladder O

which O
was O
under O
the O

Exhibit O
D8 O
also O
shows O
that O
Safikul B-WITNESS

's E-WITNESS

line O
of O
vision O
was O
not O
completely O
blocked O
. O
The O
mere O
fact O
that O
there O
were O
other O
objects O
in O
his O
line O
of O
vision O
did O
not O
prevent O
Safikul S-WITNESS

from O
observing O
the O
Appellant O

behaviour O

There O
is O
no O
reason O
for O
me O
to O
doubt O
the O
Judge O
's O
assessment O
that O
Safikul S-WITNESS

was O
well O
able O
to O
observe O
the O
Appellant O

movement O
towards O
the O
ladder O
and O
thereafter O
his O
lying O
down O

Next O

in O
an O
attempt O

challenge O
Safikul B-WITNESS

the O

relies O
on O

testimony O
that O

not O
notice O
any O

, O
the O

not O

that O

Sujon S-WITNESS

explained O
that O
the O
reason O
he O

because O
he O
was O
`` O

that O
he O

not O
know O
of O
any O

by O

of O

also O
can O
not O
possibly O
assist O
the O
Appellant O
. O
That O
Ashek S-WITNESS

does O
not O
know O
Safikul S-WITNESS

is O
irrelevant O
to O
the O
inquiry O
as O
to O
whether O
Safikul B-WITNESS

's E-WITNESS

evidence O
is O
to O
be O
believed O
. O
After O
all O
, O
they O
worked O
for O
different O
companies O
- O
Safikul S-WITNESS

worked O
for O
OUS S-ORG

while O
Ashek S-WITNESS

worked O
for O
Wee B-ORG

Seng I-ORG
. E-ORG

I O
should O
add O
that O
the O
fact O
that O
Ashek S-WITNESS

did O
not O
know O
Safikul S-WITNESS

reinforces O
my O
finding O
that O
Safikul S-WITNESS

had O
no O
reason O
to O
collude O
with O
Ashek S-WITNESS

and O
the O
other O
prosecution O
witnesses O
to O
falsely O
implicate O
the O
Appellant O
( O
this O
is O
elaborated O
at O

- O
[ O
22 O

below O
) O
. O
Further O
, O
Safikul B-WITNESS

's E-WITNESS

evidence O
was O
consistent O
throughout O
the O
trial O
. O
Even O
after O
he O
was O
recalled O
and O
the O
videos O
were O
disclosed O
, O
his O
evidence O
remained O
unshaken O
. O
He O
confirmed O
that O
his O
view O
of O
the O
ladder O
was O
not O
obstructed O
and O
that O
he O
saw O
the O
Appellant O
walk O
towards O
the O
ladder O
, O
before O
sitting O
and O
lying O
down O
on O
the O
floor O
. O
The O
Appellant O
also O
sought O
to O
discredit O
Safikul B-WITNESS

's E-WITNESS

testimony O
by O
comparing O
his O
evidence O
with O
that O
of O
Hasmot B-WITNESS

's E-WITNESS

. O
Safikul S-WITNESS

said O
that O
he O
saw O
the O
Appellant O
moving O
his O
body O
from O
side O
to O
side O
on O
the O
floor O
while O
Hasmot S-WITNESS

stated O
that O
the O
Appellant O
rolled O
his O
body O
twice O
over O
. O
However O
, O
Safikul S-WITNESS

did O
testify O
when O
he O
was O
recalled O
that O
the O
Appellant O
`` O
sat O
and O
he O
lied O
down O
, O
then O
he O
start O
to O
roll O
'' O
. O
Such O
a O
minor O
inconsistent O
description O
of O
some O
bodily O
movement O
does O
not O
affect O
Safikul B-WITNESS

's E-WITNESS

clear O
evidence O
that O
he O
saw O
the O
Appellant O
sitting O
down O
before O
lying O
down O
on O
the O
floor O
instead O
of O
falling O
off O
the O
ladder O
while O
climbing O
. O
13 O
I O
will O
now O
turn O
to O
the O
evidence O
of O
the O
other O
prosecution O
witnesses O
, O
namely O
Hasmot B-WITNESS

, E-WITNESS

Ashek B-WITNESS
, E-WITNESS

and O
Sujon B-WITNESS

. E-WITNESS

Hasmot B-WITNESS
, E-WITNESS

Ashek B-WITNESS
, E-WITNESS

and O
Sujon O
14 O
The O
Appellant O
is O
correct O
in O
stating O
that O
neither O
Hasmot B-WITNESS

, E-WITNESS

Ashek B-WITNESS
, E-WITNESS

nor O
Sujon S-WITNESS

witnessed O
what O
Safikul S-WITNESS

saw O
( O
ie O
, O
the O
Appellant O
walking O
towards O
the O
ladder O
, O
bending O
down O
, O
and O
lying O
on O
the O
floor O
) O
. O
Nonetheless O
, O
their O
evidence O
is O
relevant O
to O
the O
pivotal O
question O
of O
whether O
the O
Appellant O
had O
any O
reason O
to O
climb O
up O
the O
ladder O
to O
the O
second O
level O
of O
the O
Block O
. O
This O
, O
together O
with O
their O
observations O
of O
the O
Appellant O
's O
behaviour O
and O
reaction O
after O
the O
alleged O
fall O
, O
supports O
the O
Judge O
's O
finding O
that O
the O
Appellant O
did O
not O
fall O
while O
climbing O
up O
the O
ladder O
at O
the O
material O
time O
. O
Was O
the O
Appellant O
instructed O
to O
do O
any O
work O
on O
the O
second O
level O
? O
15 O
While O
the O
questions O
of O
whether O
the O
Appellant O
had O
any O
reason O
to O
climb O
up O
the O
ladder O
and O
whether O
he O
did O
in O
fact O
climb O
up O
the O
ladder O
are O
strictly O
separate O
inquiries O
, O
it O
is O
, O
nonetheless O
, O
crucial O
to O
understand O
the O
context O
under O
which O
the O
fall O
allegedly O
occurred O
, O
as O
recounted O
by O
the O
Appellant O
. O
It O
is O
the O
Appellant O
's O
own O
evidence O
that O
he O
was O
instructed O
by O
Hasmot S-WITNESS

to O
go O
up O
to O
the O
second O
level O
to O
`` O
cut O
the O
support O
'' O
. O
However O
, O
in O
the O
Appellant O
's O
online O
submission O
for O
his O
workplace O
injury O
claim O
he O
stated O
that O
he O
was O
instructed O
by O
Ashek S-WITNESS

instead O
to O
do O
the O
grinding O
work O
on O
the O
support O
... O
standing O
upon O
the O
staging O
ladder O
almost O
2 O
[ O
metres O
] O
[ O
high O
] O
'' O
. O
Although O
the O
Appellant O
gave O
conflicting O
accounts O
as O
to O
who O
had O
instructed O
him O
to O
go O
to O
the O
second O
level O
, O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
his O
case O
is O
that O
he O
did O
not O
use O
the O
ladder O
to O
climb O
up O
on O
his O
own O
accord O
. O
On O
either O
account O
, O
his O
evidence O
was O
that O
he O
was O
instructed O
to O
do O
so O
. O
Therefore O
, O
on O
the O
Appellant O
's O
own O
case O
, O
the O
two O
inquiries O
are O
inextricably O
connected O
. O
If O
he O
was O
not O
instructed O
by O
Hasmot S-WITNESS

or O
Ashek S-WITNESS

to O
do O
any O
work O
on O
the O
second O
level O
as O
he O
claimed O
, O
it O
stands O
to O
reason O
that O
the O
Appellant O
, O
by O
his O
own O
evidence O
, O
had O
no O
reason O
to O
use O
the O
ladder O
and O
consequently O
did O
not O
fall O
while O
climbing O
up O
the O
ladder O
. O
16 O
Ashek B-WITNESS

, E-WITNESS

who O
is O
the O
Appellant O
's O
supervisor O
, O
testified O
that O
the O
Appellant O
had O
no O
reason O
to O
use O
the O
ladder O
at O
the O
material O
time O
. O
This O
was O
not O
challenged O
. O
According O
to O
Hasmot B-WITNESS

, E-WITNESS

the O
Appellant O
had O
complained O
that O
he O
was O
suffering O
from O
a O
stomach O
ache O
and O
a O
headache O
. O
It O
was O
Hasmot B-WITNESS

's E-WITNESS

evidence O
that O
he O
told O
the O
Appellant O
to O
`` O
take O
[ O
a O
] O
rest O
'' O
and O
that O
he O
did O
not O
need O
to O
work O
. O
He O
added O
that O
there O
was O
no O
urgency O
to O
finish O
the O
work O
as O
they O
were O
not O
on O
a O
tight O
schedule O
. O
There O
is O
also O
no O
dispute O
that O
Hasmot S-WITNESS

did O
contact O
Ashek B-WITNESS

, E-WITNESS

his O
supervisor O
, O
to O
get O
a O
replacement O
for O
the O
Appellant O
after O
the O
latter O
claimed O
that O
he O
was O
not O
feeling O
well O
. O
It O
was O
during O
this O
call O
that O
the O
Appellant O
allegedly O
climbed O
the O
ladder O
to O
undertake O
some O
work O
on O
the O
second O
floor O
and O
thereafter O
allegedly O
fell O
from O
the O
ladder O
. O
However O
, O
it O
was O
never O
put O
to O
Hasmot S-WITNESS

that O
he O
had O
specifically O
instructed O
the O
Appellant O
to O
go O
to O
the O
second O
level O
to O
do O
some O
work O
, O
whether O
it O
was O
cutting O
or O
grinding O
or O
even O
both O
. O
Instead O
, O
all O
that O
was O
put O
to O
Hasmot S-WITNESS

was O
that O
he O
had O
told O
the O
Appellant O
to O
continue O
working O
and O
`` O
so O
he O
went O
and O
climbed O
to O
level O
2 O
'' O
. O
The O
distinction O
between O
the O
two O
is O
quite O
material O
because O
it O
was O
the O
Appellant O
's O
own O
evidence O
that O
Hasmot S-WITNESS

had O
specifically O
instructed O
him O
to O
go O
to O
the O
second O
level O
to O
`` O
cut O
the O
support O
'' O
. O
Further O
, O
during O
the O
hearing O
of O
the O
appeal O
, O
Mr B-LAWYER

Balchandani E-LAWYER

submitted O
that O
Hasmot S-WITNESS

had O
lied O
in O
that O
he O
only O
contacted O
Ashek S-WITNESS

and O
requested O
for O
a O
replacement O
after O
the O
Appellant O
had O
fallen O
from O
the O
ladder O
. O
However O
, O
when O
probed O
, O
he O
conceded O
that O
this O
was O
never O
put O
to O
Hasmot S-WITNESS

in O
cross-examination O
. O
Leaving O
aside O
for O
the O
moment O
the O
Appellant O
's O
conflicting O
evidence O
as O
to O
the O
nature O
of O
work O
he O
was O
tasked O
to O
do O
on O
the O
second O
level O
, O
I O
agree O
with O
the O
Prosecution O
and O
, O
in O
particular O
, O
the O
Judge O
's O
finding O
that O
there O
was O
no O
reason O
for O
the O
Appellant O
, O
`` O
in O
his O
'stricken O
' O
condition O
'' O
, O
to O
do O
any O
work O
on O
the O
second O
level O
of O
the O
Block O
at O
the O
time O
of O
the O
incident O
( O
see O
the O
GD O
at O
[ O
32 O
] O
) O
. O
Not O
only O
was O
the O
Appellant O
allegedly O
unwell O
, O
Hasmot S-WITNESS

had O
specifically O
told O
him O
that O
he O
had O
`` O
no O
need O
to O
work O
'' O
as O
Hasmot O
was O
already O
calling O
for O
a O
replacement O
for O
him O
. O
The O
Appellant O
did O
not O
dispute O
the O
fact O
that O
Hasmot S-WITNESS

had O
made O
these O
statements O
to O
him O
and O
I O
see O
no O
reason O
to O
disbelieve O
Hasmot B-WITNESS

's E-WITNESS

evidence O
. O
17 O
Another O
important O
point O
to O
note O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
Appellant O
was O
barely O
a O
metre O
from O
Hasmot S-WITNESS

at O
the O
time O
of O
the O
incident O
. O
It O
would O
be O
too O
much O
of O
a O
coincidence O
that O
the O
Appellant O
would O
use O
the O
ladder O
to O
climb O
to O
the O
second O
level O
to O
do O
work O
which O
he O
was O
not O
instructed O
to O
do O
at O
the O
precise O
moment O
when O
Hasmot S-WITNESS

had O
his O
back O
turned O
away O
from O
the O
Appellant O
while O
calling O
Ashek S-WITNESS

for O
the O
replacement O
worker O
. O
It O
is O
therefore O
difficult O
to O
imagine O
how O
Hasmot S-WITNESS

would O
not O
have O
noticed O
the O
Appellant O
climbing O
and O
falling O
from O
the O
ladder O
if O
that O
had O
actually O
happened O
. O
18 O
The O
prosecution O
witnesses O
' O
observations O
of O
the O
Appellant O
's O
behaviour O
and O
reaction O
after O
the O
alleged O
fall O
also O
support O
the O
Judge O
's O
finding O
that O
the O
Appellant O
did O
not O
fall O
while O
climbing O
up O
the O
ladder O
. O
According O
to O
Hasmot B-WITNESS

, E-WITNESS

when O
the O
Appellant O
was O
on O
the O
floor O
, O
he O
complained O
to O
Hasmot S-WITNESS

that O
he O
had O
`` O
more O
stomach O
and O
headache O
'' O
. O
Ashek O
also O
consistently O
testified O
that O
when O
he O
saw O
the O
Appellant O
, O
he O
was O
rubbing O
`` O
both O
hands O
on O
his O
stomach O
'' O
. O
In O
fact O
, O
on O
seeing O
the O
Appellant O
in O
this O
condition O
, O
he O
thought O
that O
he O
was O
suffering O
from O
stomach O
pain O
. O
What O
is O
particularly O
telling O
is O
that O
Ashek S-WITNESS

did O
not O
see O
the O
Appellant O
holding O
onto O
his O
back O
at O
any O
time O
. O
Likewise O
, O
Sujon S-WITNESS

testified O
that O
when O
he O
arrived O
at O
the O
scene O
of O
the O
alleged O
accident O
, O
he O
saw O
the O
Appellant O
rubbing O
his O
stomach O
. O
All O
these O
unchallenged O
observations O
are O
entirely O
inconsistent O
with O
the O
Appellant O
's O
claim O
that O
he O
injured O
his O
back O
as O
a O
result O
of O
his O
alleged O
fall O
. O
19 O
It O
is O
futile O
for O
the O
Appellant O
to O
identify O
inconsistencies O
in O
the O
evidence O
of O
the O
prosecution O
witnesses O
where O
they O
have O
no O
bearing O
to O
the O
relevant O
issues O
before O
the O
court O
. O
The O
Appellant O
identifies O
inconsistencies O
such O
as O
( O
a O
) O
when O
lunch O
break O
was O
held O
; O
( O
b O
) O
whom O
they O
had O
lunch O
with O
; O
( O
c O
) O
who O
was O
the O
first O
to O
attend O
to O
the O
Appellant O
, O
( O
d O
) O
whether O
Ashek S-WITNESS

had O
poured O
water O
on O
the O
Appellant O
's O
head O
; O
and O
( O
e O
) O
who O
had O
helped O
the O
Appellant O
to O
the O
Shipyard O
clinic O
. O
In O
my O
view O
, O
these O
trivial O
discrepancies O
are O
not O
material O
to O
the O
relevant O
inquiry O
as O
to O
whether O
the O
Appellant O
had O
any O
reason O
to O
use O
the O
ladder O
and O
whether O
he O
fell O
from O
the O
ladder O
in O
the O
process O
. O
Given O
Hasmot B-WITNESS

's E-WITNESS

evidence O
that O
he O
had O
told O
the O
Appellant O
to O
rest O
, O
coupled O
with O
the O
Appellant O
's O
failure O
to O
put O
to O
Hasmot S-WITNESS

that O
he O
had O
specifically O
instructed O
the O
Appellant O
to O
go O
to O
the O
second O
level O
to O
do O
work O
, O
it O
is O
simply O
not O
open O
to O
the O
Appellant O
to O
challenge O
the O
Judge O
's O
finding O
that O
he O
did O
not O
fall O
while O
climbing O
up O
the O
ladder O
. O
He O
had O
no O
reason O
to O
go O
up O
to O
the O
second O
level O
to O
begin O
with O
. O
Collusion O
- O
a O
baseless O
submission O
20 O
It O
is O
unacceptable O
for O
the O
Appellant O
to O
rely O
on O
these O
irrelevant O
inconsistencies O
to O
make O
the O
astonishing O
submission O
that O
such O
inconsistencies O
arose O
because O
the O
prosecution O
witnesses O
were O
`` O
told O
generally O
to O
state O
that O
the O
Appellant O
feigned O
the O
accident O
but O
the O
details O
as O
to O
how O
he O
feigned O
the O
accident O
were O
lost O
in O
translation O
'' O
. O
In O
essence O
, O
the O

case O
is O
that O
Hasmot B-WITNESS

Safikul S-WITNESS

had O
colluded O
to O

an O
innocent O
man O
but O
somehow O
the O
collusion O
was O
carried O
out O
incompetently O
. O
The O
Appellant O
expressly O
submits O
: O
... O
that O
the O
witnesses O
had O
colluded O
or O
rehearsed O
some O
part O
of O
their O
testimon O
[ O
ies O
] O
to O
promote O
a O
larger O
objective O
. O
The O
larger O
objective O
is O
to O
accuse O
the O
Appellant O
of O
fabricating O
the O
incident O
so O
that O

I O
agree O
with O
the O
Prosecution O
that O
there O
is O
no O
evidence O
for O
this O
incredible O
claim O
. O
In O
my O
view O
, O
there O
is O
no O
conceivable O
motive O
for O
any O
of O
the O
prosecution O
witnesses O
to O
have O
colluded O
against O
the O
Appellant O
. O
Quite O
apart O
from O
the O
undeniable O
fact O
that O
it O
was O
never O
put O
to O
any O
of O
them O
that O
they O
had O
colluded O
with O
one O
another O
to O
concoct O
false O
evidence O
against O
the O
Appellant O
, O
it O
bears O
mention O
that O
all O
of O
them O
, O
save O
for O
Safikul B-WITNESS

, E-WITNESS

were O
identified O
by O
the O
Appellant O
as O
his O
witnesses O
whom O
the O
Ministry O
of O
Manpower O
( O
`` O
MOM O
'' O
) O
could O
inquire O
with O
in O
order O
to O
verify O
his O
compensation O
claim O
. O
The O
significance O
of O
the O
Appellant O
's O
choice O
lies O
in O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
Appellant O
obviously O
regarded O
them O
as O
witnesses O
who O
would O
speak O
the O
truth O
should O
they O
be O
approached O
by O

to O

This O
makes O
the O
failure O
to O
put O
the O
collusion O
allegation O
to O
them O
all O
the O
more O
egregious O
. O
While O
it O
was O
suggested O
to O

that O
they O
had O
lied O
in O

to O
certain O

of O

, O
that O
the O

23 O
Unlike O
the O

, O
the O
discrepancies O
in O

Appellant O

evidence O
were O
significant O
as O
they O
directly O
concerned O
the O
circumstances O
of O

The O
discrepancies O
in O
the O
Appellant O

evidence O
relate O
to O
( O
a O
) O
his O
reasons O
for O
climbing O
the O
ladder O
; O
( O
b O
) O
whether O
he O
was O
wearing O
a O
helmet O
at O
the O
time O
of O

; O
( O
c O
) O
whether O

whether O

24 O
The O
Judge O
found O
that O
the O
Appellant O
gave O
inconsistent O
explanations O
as O
to O
why O
he O
had O
to O
use O
the O
ladder O
to O
get O
up O
to O
the O
second O
level O
of O
the O
Block O
. O
For O
the O
appeal O
, O
Mr B-LAWYER

Balchandani E-LAWYER

devotes O
much O
effort O
to O
explain O
that O
the O
Appellant O
's O
evidence O
in O
this O
regard O
was O
not O
in O
fact O
inconsistent O
. O
According O
to O
Mr B-LAWYER

Balchandani I-LAWYER
, E-LAWYER

there O
was O
apparently O
some O
confusion O
in O
the O
Appellant O
's O
evidence O
as O
to O
whether O
cutting O
and O
grinding O
were O
separate O
tasks O
when O
in O
truth O
they O
meant O
the O
same O
thing O
. O
He O
submits O
that O
the O
Judge O
failed O
to O
take O
into O
account O
the O
Appellant O
's O
clarifications O
in O
re-examination O
. O
25 O
The O
Appellant O
initially O
testified O
that O
he O
had O
to O
do O
`` O
pipe O
support O
work O
'' O
. O
Later O
, O
he O
testified O
that O
he O
went O
up O
to O
the O
second O
level O
to O
`` O
cut O
a O
support O
'' O
. O
This O
differed O
from O
his O
online O
form O
to O
MOM S-ORG

and O
earlier O
statement O
to O
MOM S-ORG

where O
he O
claimed O
that O
he O
was O
to O
do O
grinding O
work O
. O
He O
then O
tried O
to O
equate O
cutting O
with O
grinding O
despite O
explaining O
that O
grinding O
was O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
smoothening O
the O
surface O
. O
The O
Appellant O
argues O
that O
cutting O
requires O
using O
a O
different O
edge O
of O
the O
disc O
of O
the O
grinding O
machine O
but O
this O
does O
not O
change O
the O
fact O
that O
his O
testimony O
was O
inconsistent O
in O
respect O
of O
the O
type O
of O
work O
he O
was O
engaged O
in O
. O
However O
, O
in O
his O
re-examination O
, O
the O
Appellant O
, O
in O
response O
to O
Mr B-LAWYER

Balchandani I-LAWYER
's E-LAWYER

question O
as O
to O
whether O
cutting O
and O
grinding O
in O
the O
industry O
mean O
the O
same O
thing O
, O
answered O
in O
the O
affirmative O
. O
26 O
In O
my O
view O
, O
it O
is O
a O
wholly O
misdirected O
exercise O
to O
seek O
to O
reconcile O
the O
different O
explanations O
provided O
by O
the O
Appellant O
as O
to O
the O
work O
he O
was O
tasked O
to O
do O
on O
the O
second O
level O
before O
he O
allegedly O
fell O
. O
Even O
if O
I O
am O
prepared O
to O
give O
the O
Appellant O
the O
benefit O
of O
the O
doubt O
that O
he O
might O
have O
provided O
inconsistent O
answers O
about O
the O
task O
he O
was O
asked O
to O
do O
on O
the O
second O
level O
because O
he O
did O
not O
fully O
understand O
the O
questions O
asked O
of O
him O
in O
cross-examination O
, O
it O
is O
important O
not O
to O
lose O
sight O
of O
the O
real O
significance O
of O
this O
line O
of O
questioning O
. O
Its O
significance O
lies O
in O
establishing O
whether O
the O
Appellant O
had O
any O
reason O
to O
use O
the O
ladder O
in O
the O
first O
place O
. O
It O
should O
not O
be O
overlooked O
that O
the O
Appellant O
was O
assisting O
Hasmot S-WITNESS

with O
his O
work O
that O
day O
. O
It O
is O
the O
Appellant O
's O
own O
evidence O
that O
he O
was O
instructed O
by O
Hasmot S-WITNESS

to O
go O
up O
to O
the O
second O
level O
to O
`` O
cut O
the O
support O
'' O
. O
However O
, O
it O
was O
never O
put O
to O
Hasmot O
that O
he O
had O
specifically O
instructed O
the O
Appellant O
to O
do O
any O
work O
on O
the O
second O
level O
of O
the O
Block O
. O
This O
was O
a O
significant O
omission O
considering O
Hasmot B-WITNESS

's E-WITNESS

evidence O
that O
he O
had O
told O
the O
Appellant O
to O
rest O
as O
he O
was O
calling O
for O
a O
replacement O
worker O
. O
In O
other O
words O
, O
Hasmot B-WITNESS

, E-WITNESS

whom O
the O
Appellant O
was O
assisting O
, O
did O
not O
task O
the O
Appellant O
to O
do O
any O
work O
on O
the O
second O
level O
. O
27 O
Second O
, O
the O
Appellant O
gave O
vacillating O
accounts O
as O
to O
whether O
he O
was O
wearing O
a O
helmet O
when O
he O
hit O
the O
ground O
. O
Initially O
, O
he O
could O
not O
remember O
if O
the O
helmet O
was O
on O
his O
head O
because O
he O
claimed O
to O
have O
lost O
his O
`` O
memory O
'' O
and O
consciousness O
when O
he O
hit O
the O
ground O
. O
Subsequently O
, O
when O
the O
Appellant O
was O
asked O
to O
provide O
an O
explanation O
as O
to O
why O
he O
did O
not O
suffer O
from O
a O
head O
injury O
, O
he O
then O
changed O
his O
explanation O
that O
this O
was O
because O
he O
was O
wearing O
his O
helmet O
when O
he O
hit O
the O
ground O
. O
When O
questioned O
further O
as O
to O
whether O
his O
helmet O
was O
on O
his O
head O
when O
he O
hit O
the O
ground O
, O
he O
said O
that O
after O
he O
fell O
down O
, O
he O
`` O
can O
not O
say O
anything O
'' O
. O
I O
accept O
that O
there O
might O
be O
some O
doubt O
as O
to O
whether O
the O
Appellant O
was O
wearing O
a O
helmet O
when O
he O
was O
observed O
to O
be O
walking O
to O
the O
ladder O
area O
. O
In O
this O
respect O
, O
I O
note O
that O
Safikul S-WITNESS

testified O
that O
he O
saw O
the O
Appellant O
wearing O
a O
helmet O
as O
he O
walked O
towards O
the O
ladder O
( O
not O
when O
he O
was O
found O
lying O
on O
the O
ground O
) O
while O
the O
objective O
evidence O
suggests O
otherwise O
. O
In O
Exhibit O
D3 O
, O
one O
of O
the O
persons O
in O
the O
Appellant O
's O
vicinity O
when O
he O
was O
on O
the O
ground O
can O
be O
heard O
repeatedly O
asking O
the O
Appellant O
, O
`` O
where O
is O
your O
helmet O
? O
'' O
Further O
, O
Exhibits O
D4 O
and O
D7 O
show O
the O
Appellant O
's O
position O
on O
the O
ground O
after O
the O
fall O
but O
no O
helmet O
could O
be O
seen O
in O
the O
vicinity O
. O
However O
, O
the O
materiality O
of O
the O
Appellant O
's O
conflicting O
accounts O
lies O
in O
the O
reason O
for O
his O
vacillations O
and O
not O
the O
factual O
inquiry O
per O
se O
as O
to O
whether O
he O
was O
in O
fact O
wearing O
a O
helmet O
. O
It O
appears O
to O
me O
that O
he O
changed O
his O
evidence O
in O
order O
to O
reconcile O
the O
fact O
that O
he O
did O
not O
sustain O
any O
head O
injury O
notwithstanding O
that O
his O
head O
allegedly O
hit O
the O
ground O
causing O
him O
to O
lose O
consciousness O
momentarily O
. O
28 O
Third O
, O
although O
the O
Appellant O
claims O
that O
he O
was O
unconscious O
immediately O
following O
his O
fall O
, O
this O
is O
not O
supported O
by O
any O
objective O
evidence O
. O
It O
is O
not O
disputed O
that O
no O
one O
saw O
the O
Appellant O
in O
an O
unconscious O
state O
. O
What O
I O
find O
interesting O
is O
the O
Appellant O
's O
claim O
that O
someone O
must O
have O
removed O
his O
helmet O
when O
he O
was O
on O
the O
floor O
in O
order O
to O
pour O
water O
on O
his O
head O
. O
He O
said O
he O
saw O
Hasmot S-WITNESS

pouring O
water O
on O
his O
head O
while O
he O
was O
lying O
on O
the O
ground O
and O
that O
Sujon S-WITNESS

also O
told O
him O
that O
he O
did O
the O
same O
. O
This O
was O
confirmed O
by O
Hasmot S-WITNESS

and O
Sujon B-WITNESS

. E-WITNESS

In O
fact O
, O
Sujon S-WITNESS

testified O
under O
cross-examination O
that O
he O
poured O
the O
water O
at O
the O
Appellant O
's O
request O
because O
he O
claimed O
to O
be O
suffering O
from O
a O
headache O
and O
not O
because O
they O
found O
him O
in O
an O
unconscious O
state O
. O
Both O
Hasmot B-WITNESS

's E-WITNESS

and O
Sujon B-WITNESS

's E-WITNESS

evidence O
was O
unchallenged O
. O
That O
water O
was O
poured O
at O
the O
request O
of O
the O
Appellant O
because O
he O
had O
complained O
of O
a O
headache O
is O
neither O
consistent O
with O
the O
Appellant O
's O
alleged O
back O
injury O
nor O
a O
reaction O
from O
an O
unconscious O
person O
. O
29 O
Fourth O
, O
even O
though O
Mr B-LAWYER

Balchandani E-LAWYER

( O
presumably O
on O
the O
Appellant O
's O
instructions O
) O
had O
put O
it O
to O
Ashek S-WITNESS

that O
he O
and O
a O
few O
others O
carried O
the O
Appellant O
from O
the O
hospital O
or O
from O
the O
clinic O
to O
the O
lorry O
, O
this O
was O
refuted O
by O
the O
Appellant O
himself O
who O
said O
that O
his O
friends O
had O
merely O
helped O
him O
to O
walk O
and O
that O
he O
climbed O
onto O
the O
lorry O
on O
his O
own O
. O
The O
video O
in O
Exhibit O
D6 O
likewise O
shows O
the O
Appellant O
walking O
unassisted O
towards O
the O
lorry O
and O
climbing O
up O
the O
lorry O
with O
its O
tailgate O
still O
up O
. O
30 O
In O
the O
circumstances O
, O
there O
is O
no O
reason O
to O
disturb O
the O
Judge O
's O
finding O
that O
the O
Appellant O
's O
evidence O
was O
indeed O
`` O
inconsistent O
, O
incoherent O
or O
incredible O
'' O
( O
see O
the O
GD O
at O
[ O

) O
. O
In O
any O
event O
, O
his O
evidence O
did O
not O
undermine O
the O
Prosecution O

evidence O
. O
The O
medical O
evidence O

I O
turn O
now O

In O
examining O
the O
medical O
evidence O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
bear O
in O
mind O
the O
Appellant O
's O
claims O
that O
he O
lost O
consciousness O
after O
the O
fall O
and O
that O
the O
pain O
due O
to O
his O
back O
injury O
was O
at O
the O
maximum O
level O
of O
10 O
even O
after O
he O
was O
administered O
two O
pain O
killer O
injections O
. O
Therefore O
, O
if O
the O
Appellant O
's O
evidence O
is O
to O
be O
believed O
, O
the O
fall O
and O
the O
consequent O
injury O
must O
have O
been O
quite O
severe O
. O
However O
, O
does O
the O
medical O
evidence O
bear O
out O
the O
severe O
back O
injury O
claimed O
by O
the O
Appellant O
? O
32 O
The O
convictions O
against O
the O
Appellant O
are O
premised O
on O
the O
falsity O
of O
his O
claim O
that O
he O
fell O
while O
climbing O
up O
a O
ladder O
to O
do O
some O
work O
on O
the O
second O
level O
and O
thereby O
sustained O
injury O
to O
his O
back O
. O
Hence O
, O
the O
question O
is O
whether O
the O
medical O
evidence O
before O
the O
court O
has O
raised O
any O
reasonable O
doubt O
that O
the O
Appellant O
falsely O
claimed O
that O
he O
fell O
from O
the O
ladder O
and O
suffered O
a O
back O
injury O
as O
a O
result O
, O
and O
not O
whether O
the O
Appellant O
suffered O
any O
back O
strain O
or O
contusion O
per O
se O
. O
Pertinently O
, O
even O
if O
it O
is O
accepted O
that O
the O
Appellant O
was O
suffering O
from O
some O
back O
injury O
, O
the O
court O
must O
ask O
whether O
the O
evidence O
has O
established O
that O
the O
back O
injury O
was O
actually O
caused O
by O
the O
fall O
. O
In O
this O
regard O
, O
the O
medical O
evidence O
must O
necessarily O
be O
assessed O
with O
reference O
to O
the O
Appellant O
's O
evidence O
of O
the O
nature O
of O
his O
fall O
and O
the O
extent O
of O
his O
injury O
. O
It O
is O
also O
critical O
to O
examine O
the O
medical O
evidence O
with O
reference O
to O
the O
evidence O
of O

diagnosis O
that O

from O

premised O
on O
the O

history O
, O
his O
physical O
examination O
of O
the O
Appellant O
, O
as O
well O
as O
a O

. O
He O
explained O
that O
his O
physical O
examination O
involved O
an O
observation O
of O
the O
Appellant O

posture O
and O
by O
palpation O
, O
ie O
, O
feeling O
the O
location O

He O

that O
the O

that O

`` O

of O
information O
leading O

he O
explained O
that O
the O

must O
go O
`` O

asked O
how O
such O

results O
could O
be O
consistent O
with O
the O
diagnosis O
of O

, O
Dr B-WITNESS

explained O
that O
the O
diagnosis O
was O
`` O

that O

for O

who O
come O
in O
with O
the O
complaints O
of O
back O
pain O
although O
the O
physical O
examination O
itself O
is O
unremarkable O
'' O
. O
36 O
I O
agree O
with O
the O
Prosecution O
that O
there O
is O
no O
objective O
evidence O
to O
support O
the O
Appellant O
's O
case O
that O
he O
suffered O
from O
any O
back O
injury O
as O
a O
result O
of O
falling O
from O
the O
ladder O
. O
The O
Appellant O
claims O
that O
he O
lost O
consciousness O
after O
the O
fall O
and O
experienced O
pain O
at O
the O
maximum O
level O
of O
10 O
. O
However O
, O
the O
evidence O
shows O
that O
there O
was O
no O
bruising O
or O
swelling O
and O
that O
the O
X-rays O
and O
CT O
scans O
were O
unremarkable O
and O
did O
not O
reveal O
any O
fresh O
injury O
. O
In O
my O
view O
, O
such O
severe O
pain O
is O
entirely O
inconsistent O
with O
the O
complete O
lack O
of O
objective O
evidence O
such O
as O
bruising O
, O
swelling O
, O
or O
tenderness O
. O
Mr B-LAWYER

relies O

clinic O
before O
he O
boarded O
the O

in O
his O
effort O
to O
explain O
why O
the O
Appellant O
was O
able O
to O
board O
the O
lorry O
without O
assistance O
. O
However O
, O
as O
the O
Judge O
noted O
at O
[ O
55 O
] O
of O
the O
GD O
, O
the O
Appellant O
claimed O
that O
the O
pain O
was O
still O
at O
the O
maximum O
level O
of O
`` O
10 O
'' O
even O
after O
the O
injections O
. O
37 O
Further O
, O
having O
reviewed O
the O
video O
evidence O
, O
I O
find O
that O
the O
videos O
are O
entirely O
inconsistent O
with O
the O
fall O
as O
described O
by O
the O
Appellant O
. O
For O
instance O
, O
immediately O
after O
the O
alleged O
fall O
, O
he O
was O
found O
on O
the O
floor O
rubbing O
his O

He O
did O
not O
indicate O

the O

who O
attended O
to O
him O
, O
that O
his O
back O
was O
injured O
. O
Also O
, O
the O
Appellant O
was O
able O
to O
walk O
and O
climb O
onto O
the O
lorry O
without O
assistance O
. O
Mr B-LAWYER

Balchandani E-LAWYER

submits O
that O
the O
Appellant O
climbed O
up O
the O
lorry O
unassisted O
because O
he O
was O
ordered O
to O
do O
so O
. O
That O
submission O
misses O
the O
point O
. O
If O
the O
injury O
was O
so O
severe O
( O
based O
on O
the O
Appellant O
's O
claim O
that O
he O
lost O
consciousness O
and O
experienced O
the O
maximum O
pain O
level O
of O
`` O
10 O
'' O
even O
after O
the O
two O
injections O
) O
, O
in O
all O
likelihood O
, O
it O
would O
not O
have O
been O
possible O
for O
the O
Appellant O
to O
climb O
onto O
the O
lorry O
without O
assistance O
even O
if O
he O
had O
been O
told O
to O
do O
so O
. O
38 O
While O
the O
doctors O
opined O
under O
cross-examination O
( O
upon O
being O
recalled O
as O
witnesses O
) O
that O
it O
was O
`` O
possible O
'' O
or O
that O
it O
would O
`` O
appear O
to O
be O
'' O
the O
case O
that O
the O
Appellant O
's O
back O
injury O
was O
consistent O
with O
him O
having O
fallen O
from O
the O
ladder O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
refrain O
from O
quoting O
their O
evidence O
out O
of O
context O
. O
Quite O
often O
, O
a O
witness O
' O
answer O
depends O
on O
how O
the O
question O
is O
framed O
. O
Hence O
, O
it O
is O
always O
essential O
to O
analyse O
the O
evidence O
on O
the O
whole O
and O
in O
its O
proper O
context O
. O
When O
Dr B-WITNESS

Ding E-WITNESS

was O
asked O
why O
he O
thought O
the O
Appellant O
's O
back O
injury O
was O
most O
likely O
consistent O
with O
the O
alleged O
fall O
, O
he O
explained O
`` O
[ O
b O
] O
ecause O
I O
mean O
from O
the O
history O
it O
says O
that O
he O
fell O
from O
the O
ladder O
and O
landed O
on O
his O
back O
and O
there O
is O
a O
ladder O
and O
then O
he O
's O
shown O
on O
his O
back O
in O
the O
video O
'' O
[ O
emphasis O
added O
] O
. O
From O
my O
assessment O
of O
their O
evidence O
as O
a O
whole O
, O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
their O
diagnoses O
of O
possible O
back O
injury O
were O
based O
on O
the O
Appellant O
's O
account O
of O
the O
alleged O
incident O
together O
with O
the O
Appellant O
's O
indication O
of O
the O
location O
of O
the O
pain O
. O
What O
is O
noteworthy O
is O
that O
none O
of O
the O
doctors O
testified O
that O
they O
would O
have O
arrived O
at O
their O
diagnoses O
or O
concluded O
that O
the O
Appellant O
's O
back O
injury O
was O
due O
to O
a O
fall O
from O
a O
ladder O
without O
the O
Appellant O
's O
oral O
history O
. O
Dr B-WITNESS

Catabas E-WITNESS

testified O
that O
looking O
at O
the O
videos O
alone O
, O
without O
the O
history O
from O
the O
patient O
, O
he O
would O
not O
be O
able O
to O
make O
his O
diagnosis O
. O
He O
stated O
clearly O
that O
he O
would O
`` O
still O
need O
the O
history O
from O
the O
patient O
'' O
. O
Likewise O
, O
Dr O
Ding O
testified O
that O
without O
the O
history O
, O
it O
would O
`` O
not O
[ O
be O
] O
possible O
to O
determine O
the O
cause O
'' O
and O
it O
would O
be O
`` O
hard O
to O
be O
certain O
of O
a O
fixed O
diagnosis O
'' O
. O
Further O
, O
although O
both O
doctors O
testified O
that O
there O
were O
many O
possible O
causes O
for O
the O
back O
injury O
, O
neither O
of O
them O
was O
able O
to O
state O
affirmatively O
that O
the O
back O
injury O
( O
assuming O
that O
it O
did O
exist O
) O
was O
linked O
to O
the O
Appellant O
's O
fall O
from O
the O
ladder O
. O
In O
my O
view O
, O
contrary O
to O
the O
Appellant O
's O
written O
submissions O
, O
the O
medical O
evidence O
does O
not O
raise O
any O
reasonable O
doubt O
that O
the O
Appellant O
falsely O
claimed O
that O
the O
back O
injury O
was O
caused O
by O
the O
alleged O

evidence O
was O

only O
one O
person O
other O
than O
himself O
and O
the O
deceased O
in O
the O
deceased O
's O
flat O
throughout O
the O
incident O
. O
His O
statements O
consistently O
stated O
that O
there O
was O
only O
one O
intruder O
present O
in O
the O
flat O
( O
see O
Kadar S-PRECEDENT

at O
[ O

] O
) O
. O
His O
evidence O
could O
therefore O
exculpate O
at O
least O
one O
of O
the O
two O
brothers O
. O
43 O
In O
the O
present O
case O
, O
however O
, O
the O
Exhibits O
can O
not O
by O
any O
stretch O
be O
exculpatory O
of O
the O
Appellant O
. O
I O
agree O
with O
the O
Judge O
and O
the O
Prosecution O
that O
they O
certainly O
do O
not O
strengthen O
the O
Appellant O
's O
case O
, O
and O
in O
fact O
undermine O
his O
defence O
( O
see O
the O
GD O
at O
[ O
83 O
] O
) O
. O
The O
Appellant O
submits O
the O
videos O
are O
exculpatory O
because O
they O
show O
him O
limping O
and O
show O
that O
assistance O
was O
not O
forthcoming O
even O
though O
he O
was O
in O
need O
of O
support O
. O
He O
claims O
that O
the O
Exhibits O
show O
that O
he O
had O
to O
climb O
up O
the O
lorry O
unassisted O
because O
he O
was O
forced O
to O
help O
himself O
. O
The O
Appellant O
also O
submits O
that O
the O
photographs O
were O
exculpatory O
because O
they O
evidence O
several O
things O
: O
( O
a O
) O
his O
proximity O
to O
the O
ladder O
during O
the O
incident O
; O
( O
b O
) O
his O
inability O
to O
roll O
either O
side O
as O
he O
was O
confined O
between O
the O
ladder O
and O
certain O
objects O
on O
the O
left O
; O
( O
c O
) O
that O
Safikul B-WITNESS

line O
of O
sight O
had O
been O
obstructed O
; O
and O
( O
d O
) O
that O
there O
was O
a O
pool O
of O
water O
near O
his O
head O
, O
consistent O
with O
his O
testimony O
that O
he O
had O
had O
his O
helmet O
removed O
so O
that O
water O
could O
be O
poured O
on O
his O
head O
. O
However O
, O
in O
my O
view O
, O
the O
videos O
are O
not O
exculpatory O
. O
To O
begin O
with O
, O
they O
do O
not O
record O
the O
alleged O
fall O
. O
Instead O
, O
what O
they O
show O
is O
that O
the O
Appellant O
could O
walk O
to O
and O
climb O
onto O
a O
lorry O
unassisted O
. O
In O
the O
final O
analysis O
, O
I O
agree O
with O
the O
Prosecution O
that O
the O
Exhibits O
are O
at O
best O
neutral O
, O
and O
at O
worst O
, O
corroborative O
of O
the O
Prosecution O
's O
case O
that O
the O
Appellant O
was O
feigning O
his O
injury O
. O
Such O
evidence O
does O
not O
need O
to O
be O
disclosed O

In O
closing O
submissions O
before O
the O

, O
Mr B-LAWYER

Balchandani E-LAWYER

alleged O
that O
the O
Appellant O
was O
prejudiced O
by O
the O
Prosecution O
's O
late O
disclosure O
of O
the O
Exhibits O
because O
he O
was O
prevented O
from O
discovering O
in O
time O
that O
the O
videos O
could O
have O
been O
edited O
. O
Mr B-LAWYER

Balchandani E-LAWYER

claimed O
in O
written O
closing O
submissions O
that O
it O
was O
only O
at O
the O
stage O
of O
preparing O
his O
closing O
submissions O
that O
he O
was O
able O
to O
appreciate O
that O
the O
videos O
could O
have O
been O
`` O
edited O
to O
... O
minimise O
the O
extent O
that O
the O
[ O
Appellant O
] O
suffered O
trauma O
to O
his O
back O
'' O
[ O
emphasis O
in O
original O
] O
. O
On O
appeal O
, O
Mr B-LAWYER

Balchandani E-LAWYER

maintains O
that O
he O
could O
not O
have O
substantiated O
the O
allegation O
of O
tampering O
because O
he O
did O
not O
have O
the O
opportunity O
to O
analyse O
the O
Exhibits O
due O
to O
the O
late O
disclosure O
. O
Without O
attempting O
any O
substantiation O
, O
he O
submits O
on O
appeal O
that O
`` O
the O
videos O
were O
edited O
to O
an O
extent O
to O
show O
a O
sanitized O
version O
of O
events O
'' O
[ O
emphasis O
added O
] O
. O
Before O
dealing O
with O
this O
submission O
, O
it O
should O
be O
borne O
in O
mind O
that O
it O
was O
the O
Appellant O
who O
opted O
to O
admit O
the O
Exhibits O
as O
the O
Appellant O
's O
exhibits O
in O
the O
court O
below O
. O
Hence O
, O
they O
were O
marked O
D3 O
to O
D8 O
. O
The O
tampering O
allegation O
was O
however O
never O
raised O
at O
the O
trial O
. O
Instead O
, O
it O
was O
only O
brought O
up O
for O
the O
first O
time O
in O
the O
Appellant O
's O
closing O
submissions O
after O
it O
became O
clear O
that O
the O
Prosecution O
was O
relying O
on O
the O
Exhibits O
in O
its O
closing O
submissions O
to O
undermine O
the O
Appellant O
's O
evidence O
. O
45 O
I O
find O
it O
extremely O
disturbing O
for O
Mr B-LAWYER

Balchandani E-LAWYER

to O
claim O
that O
the O
possibility O
of O
the O
videos O
having O
been O
edited O
only O
became O
apparent O
to O
him O
during O
the O
drafting O
of O
his O
closing O
submissions O
. O
Even O
if O
that O
were O
the O
case O
, O
he O
made O
no O
further O
attempt O
or O
application O
to O
the O
Judge O
to O
recall O
any O
witness O
or O
to O
offer O
new O
witnesses O
to O
make O
good O
his O
submission O

Mr B-LAWYER

also O
claims O
that O

This O

'' O
Dr O
Ding O
prior O
to O
the O
close O
of O
the O
Prosecution O
's O
case O
, O
the O
Judge O
informed O
him O
that O
the O
proper O
time O
to O
make O
the O
application O
was O
after O
the O
defence O
was O
called O
. O
Nevertheless O
, O
the O
Judge O
allowed O
the O
Appellant O

application O
to O
recall O
the O
witnesses O
but O
directed O
Mr B-LAWYER

Balchandani E-LAWYER

to O
formally O
apply O
at O
`` O
the O
appropriate O
time O
'' O
. O
Eventually O
, O
after O
the O
Appellant O
had O
completed O
his O
testimony O
, O
Mr B-LAWYER

Balchandani E-LAWYER

made O
a O
specific O
application O
to O

only O
the O
two O
doctors O
and O
Safikul B-WITNESS

. E-WITNESS

The O
Judge O
allowed O
the O
application O
despite O
the O
Prosecution O

objections O
. O
Thus O
, O
it O
would O
appear O
that O
it O
was O
Mr B-LAWYER

Balchandani E-LAWYER

who O
decided O
not O
to O
recall O
Hasmot B-WITNESS

, E-WITNESS

Ashek B-WITNESS

or O
any O

it O
is O

disingenuous O
and O

to O
criticise O
the O
Judge O
for O
failing O
to O
recall O
them O
on O
his O
own O
motion O
. O
46 O
The O
suggestion O
that O
the O
late O
disclosure O
was O
done O
to O

the O

is O
also O
a O
non-starter O

It O
is O
clear O
that O
the O

had O
more O
than O
enough O
time O
to O
consider O
the O
steps O
that O
he O
wished O
to O
take O

including O

applying O

to O
demonstrate O
that O
the O

had O
been O
tampered O

. O
In O
fact O
, O
counsel O
for O
the O
Appellant O
indicated O
on O
13 B-DATE

that O
he O
needed O
time O
to O
find O

witnesses O
to O

the O
contents O
of O

. O
However O
, O
he O
eventually O
did O
not O
offer O
any O
expert O
witness O
. O
47 O
In O
the O
circumstances O
, O
it O
is O
reckless O
for O
Mr B-LAWYER

Balchandani E-LAWYER

to O
suggest O
that O
the O
videos O
had O
been O
tampered O
with O
when O
there O
is O
simply O
no O
evidential O
basis O
whatsoever O
to O
support O
such O
a O
speculative O
suggestion O
. O
Although O
this O
is O
a O
very O
serious O
allegation O
, O
it O
was O
never O
put O
to O
any O
witness O
. O
Further O
, O
although O
the O
Appellant O
was O
given O
the O
option O
of O
recalling O
witnesses O
, O
he O
chose O
not O
to O
recall O
the O
IO O
. O
This O
is O
significant O
because O
the O
IO S-WITNESS

was O
the O
witness O
who O
received O
the O
videos O
from O
the O
Shipyard O
and O
was O
therefore O
the O
person O
who O
could O
possibly O
explain O
the O
provenance O
of O
the O
videos O
. O
If O
Mr B-LAWYER

Balchandani E-LAWYER

wanted O
to O
pursue O
the O
tampering O
allegation O
, O
he O
should O
have O
at O
least O
recalled O
the O
IO O
to O
initiate O
the O
train O
of O
inquiry O
. O
Having O
elected O
not O
to O
do O
so O
, O
any O
suggestion O
of O
the O
videos O
having O
been O
tampered O
with O
is O
plainly O
baseless O
. O

duty O

Not O
all O
breaches O

this O
duty O
would O
cause O
a O

be O

( O

. O
The O
court O
also O
stated O
at O
[ O

] O
that O
where O
disclosure O
is O
made O
after O
the O
commencement O
of O
the O
trial O
, O
the O
court O
may O
grant O
an O

allow O

counsel O
time O
to O
consider O
the O
effect O
of O
the O

material O
and O
to O
incorporate O
it O
into O
their O
case O
if O
necessary O
. O
Here O
, O
this O
was O
clearly O
done O
. O
As O
explained O
, O
the O
Judge O
ensured O
that O
the O
Appellant O
had O
sufficient O
time O
to O
examine O
the O
Exhibits O
and O
to O
make O
the O
necessary O
application O
( O

) O
to O
recall O

or O
to O
take O
whatever O
further O
steps O
necessary O
( O
almost O
four O

Conclusion O
49 O
For O
these O
reasons O
, O
I O
find O
that O
the O
Judge O
was O
correct O
in O
finding O
that O
the O
two O
charges O
have O
been O
made O
out O
. O
There O
is O
also O
no O
reason O
to O
disturb O
the O
sentences O
imposed O
by O
the O
Judge O
. O
They O
are O
not O
manifestly O
excessive O
and O
are O
in O
line O
with O
the O
relevant O
precedents O
. O
Accordingly O
, O
this O

is O
dismissed O
