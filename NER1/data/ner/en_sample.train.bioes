Before O
this O
court O
, O
the O
appellant O
argued O
that O
: O
( O
a O
) O
the O
order O
allowing O
the O
respondent O
access O
to O
Child O
A O
every O
Monday O
from O
7pm O
to O
9pm O
should O
be O
revoked O
, O
as O
it O
is O
disruptive O
to O
her O
studies O
; O
( O
b O
) O
the O
order O
of O
maintenance O
for O
each O
child O
should O
be O
increased O
from O
$ O
350 O
per O
month O
to O
$ O
500 O
per O
month O
( O
total O
sum O
of O
$ O
1,500 O
) O
; O
and O
( O
c O
) O
the O
order O
pertaining O
to O
the O
disposal O
of O
the O
matrimonial O
home O
should O
be O
amended O
, O
such O
that O
rather O
than O
the O
appellant O
having O
to O
pay O
the O
respondent O
consideration O
equivalent O
to O
25 O
% O
of O
the O
net O
value O
of O
the O
matrimonial O
home O
, O
the O
appellant O
should O
only O
have O
to O
refund O
to O
the O
respondent O
's O
Central O
Provident O
Fund O
( O
`` O
CPF O
'' O
) O
account O
the O
amount O
that O
he O
had O
utilised O
for O
the O
purchase O
of O
the O
property O
, O
inclusive O
of O
accrued O
interest O
. O
I O
will O
deal O
with O
each O
of O
these O
in O
turn O
. O
4 O
First O
, O
the O
appellant O
argued O
that O
allowing O
the O
respondent O
access O
to O
Child O
A O
every O
Monday O
from O
7pm O
to O
9pm O
would O
be O
disruptive O
, O
as O
Child O
A O
usually O
has O
tuition O
classes O
on O
Mondays O
from O
7pm O
to O
8.30pm O
, O
or O
from O
5pm O
to O
6.30pm O
, O
depending O
on O
her O
school O
schedule O
and O
availability O
of O
her O
private O
tutor O
. O
In O
response O
, O
counsel O
for O
the O
respondent O
highlighted O
that O
the O
order O
for O
Monday O
access O
to O
Child O
A O
was O
indeed O
subject O
to O
tuition O
and O
school O
schedules O
, O
and O
pointed O
out O
that O
the O
Saturday O
access O
that O
was O
granted O
to O
the O
respondent O
was O
frequently O
denied O
because O
the O
appellant O
's O
mother O
would O
take O
the O
children O
out O
after O
their O
tuition O
classes O
on O
Saturday O
afternoon O
. O
It O
is O
not O
easy O
to O
determine O
who O
was O
right O
( O
if O
there O
could O
be O
a O
right O
party O
) O
in O
this O
situation O
. O
For O
the O
reasons O
that O
follow O
, O
it O
was O
not O
necessary O
for O
me O
to O
make O
a O
specific O
finding O
on O
this O
issue O
but O
the O
parties O
must O
appreciate O
what O
the O
nature O
of O
an O
access O
order O
is O
. O
Ultimately O
, O
the O
court O
has O
to O
decide O
based O
on O
the O
best O
interests O
and O
wellbeing O
of O
the O
children O
in O
making O
such O
orders O
and O
would O
do O
so O
by O
getting O
both O
parents O
involved O
in O
the O
upbringing O
of O
the O
children O
. O
It O
is O
important O
that O
the O
child O
continues O
to O
interact O
with O
both O
parents O
more O
so O
than O
issues O
of O
tuition O
schedules O
. O
I O
thus O
dismiss O
the O
appellant O
's O
appeal O
on O
the O
access O
order O
, O
and O
leave O
it O
to O
the O
parties O
to O
sort O
out O
the O
scheduling O
issues O
themselves O
, O
but O
with O
liberty O
to O
apply O
. O
5 O
Second O
, O
the O
appellant O
sought O
more O
`` O
child O
maintenance O
'' O
from O
the O
respondent O
. O
The O
appellant O
is O
earning O
about O
$ O
19,500 O
net O
per O
month O
. O
The O
respondent O
is O
earning O
about O
$ O
3,000 O
per O
month O
. O
The O
appellant O
is O
12 O
years O
younger O
than O
the O
respondent O
. O
Before O
the O
district O
judge O
, O
the O
appellant O
sought O
$ O
800 O
in O
maintenance O
per O
month O
per O
child O
, O
from O
the O
respondent O
. O
Her O
counsel O
later O
adjusted O
this O
figure O
down O
to O
$ O
500 O
. O
The O
appellant O
argued O
that O
the O
expenses O
of O
the O
three O
children O
totalled O
$ O
11,460 O
each O
month O
. O
The O
district O
judge O
deemed O
this O
an O
exorbitant O
figure O
, O
preferring O
a O
figure O
of O
$ O
4,366 O
instead O
for O
all O
three O
children O
each O
month O
, O
based O
on O
his O
calculations O
. O
The O
district O
judge O
ordered O
the O
respondent O
to O
contribute O
$ O
1,050 O
in O
maintenance O
- O
in O
total O
- O
to O
the O
three O
children O
, O
as O
he O
assessed O
this O
to O
have O
been O
about O
25 O
% O
of O
the O
expenses O
of O
the O
children O
. O
Before O
this O
court O
, O
the O
appellant O
did O
not O
argue O
that O
the O
respondent O
should O
have O
to O
bear O
more O
than O
25 O
% O
of O
the O
children O
's O
expenses O
. O
Rather O
, O
she O
disagreed O
with O
the O
district O
judge O
's O
discounting O
of O
certain O
items O
of O
expenses O
. O
For O
instance O
, O
the O
district O
judge O
found O
that O
expenses O
for O
Child O
A O
's O
tuition O
classes O
was O
not O
$ O
1,800 O
per O
month O
, O
as O
argued O
by O
the O
appellant O
, O
but O
rather O
$ O
800 O
. O
Before O
me O
, O
the O
appellant O
argued O
that O
the O
district O
judge O
was O
wrong O
. O
Further O
, O
she O
argued O
, O
since O
Child O
A O
is O
now O
in O
Secondary O
School O
, O
her O
classes O
would O
cost O
even O
more O
- O
about O
$ O
2,000 O
per O
month O
. O
In O
sum O
, O
she O
argued O
that O
the O
district O
judge O
had O
failed O
to O
take O
into O
account O
`` O
the O
financial O
needs O
of O
the O
children O
and O
the O
standard O
of O
living O
enjoyed O
by O
the O
children O
'' O
. O
These O
are O
indeed O
relevant O
factors O
to O
take O
into O
account O
, O
but O
I O
do O
not O
see O
any O
ostensible O
errors O
in O
the O
district O
judge O
's O
account O
of O
the O
appellant O
's O
alleged O
figure O
. O
The O
appellant O
did O
not O
seem O
to O
dispute O
that O
the O
respondent O
was O
earning O
$ O
3,000 O
per O
month O
, O
or O
that O
there O
was O
indeed O
a O
significant O
disparity O
between O
their O
incomes O
. O
Given O
this O
disparity O
, O
I O
dismiss O
the O
appellant O
's O
appeal O
on O
maintenance O
for O
the O
children O
. O
6 O
Third O
, O
the O
appellant O
argued O
that O
she O
should O
not O
have O
to O
pay O
the O
respondent O
25 O
% O
of O
the O
value O
of O
the O
matrimonial O
home O
- O
rather O
, O
she O
should O
only O
have O
to O
refund O
the O
appellant O
's O
CPF O
contribution O
plus O
interest O
. O
In O
monetary O
terms O
, O
this O
is O
a O
difference O
of O
between O
$ O
130,126.50 O
and O
$ O
2,188.07 O
. O
The O
district O
judge O
arrived O
at O
the O
( O
former O
) O
figure O
upon O
having O
calculated O
that O
the O
total O
assets O
of O
both O
parties O
should O
have O
been O
split O
with O
17 O
% O
going O
to O
the O
respondent O
and O
the O
remainder O
to O
the O
appellant O
. O
To O
facilitate O
the O
practical O
dividing O
of O
assets O
( O
and O
because O
having O
the O
respondent O
transfer O
his O
share O
to O
the O
appellant O
was O
the O
option O
proposed O
by O
the O
appellant O
in O
her O
first O
affidavit O
of O
assets O
and O
means O
) O
, O
the O
district O
judge O
equated O
the O
respondent O
's O
17 O
% O
share O
of O
the O
total O
assets O
to O
25 O
% O
of O
the O
matrimonial O
flat O
upon O
division O
, O
and O
hence O
made O
the O
order O
that O
the O
appellant O
simply O
pay O
the O
respondent O
consideration O
amounting O
to O
this O
25 O
% O
, O

The O

disputed O

In O
conclusion O
, O
the O
appellant O

appeal O
is O
dismissed O

It O
seemed O
to O
me O
that O
much O
of O
the O

case O
before O
me O
arose O
from O
a O
misunderstanding O
of O
the O
district O

decision O
. O
Also O
, O
especially O
with O
regard O
to O
the O
dispute O
over O
custody O
, O
the O
parties O
must O
remember O
to O
put O
the O
interests O
of O
their O
children O
before O
all O
else O
. O
Notwithstanding O
the O
importance O
of O
education O
, O
I O
reiterate O
that O
personal O
interaction O
between O
child O
and O
parent O
can O
be O
more O
crucial O
than O
tuition O
classes O
in O
the O
development O
of O
the O
child O

The O
parties O
must O
attempt O

reach O
a O
sensible O
balance O

that O

in O

out O

that O

interests O

at O

UVM S-ORG

said O
that O
as O
at O
the O
ascertainment O
date O
, O
it O
was O
insolvent O
. O
It O
had O
no O
underlying O
businesses O
and O
its O
primary O
asset O
was O
in O
the O
JAC O
shares O
which O
had O
been O
pledged O
to O
the O
Senior O
Lenders O
and O
thus O
could O
not O
be O
unilaterally O
disposed O
of O
. O
Hence O
, O
UVM S-ORG

argued O
, O
that O
from O
the O
point O
of O
view O
of O
its O
shareholders O
, O
its O
shares O
must O
be O
of O
zero O
value O
. O
Accordingly O
, O
the O
value O
of O
the O
alleged O
interest O
of O
MacNair S-ORG

and O
Emirates S-ORG

in O
UVM S-ORG

would O
correspondingly O
be O
zero O
in O
value O
, O
and O
the O
discount O
on O
their O
votes O
would O
be O
zero O
as O
well O
. O
I O
was O
not O
convinced O
that O
the O
value O
of O
UVM B-ORG

's E-ORG

shares O
from O
the O
perspective O
of O
the O
shareholders O
( O
or O
of O
MacNair S-ORG

and O
Emirates B-ORG

) E-ORG

must O
be O
zero O
. O
As O
pointed O
out O
by O
SKEC B-RESPONDENT

, E-RESPONDENT

although O
JAC S-ORG

was O
in O
receivership O
, O
it O
had O
recently O
began O
operations O
and O
there O
was O
a O
prospect O
that O
it O
might O
become O
profitable O
. O
This O
would O
translate O
to O
an O
increase O
in O
value O
of O
UVM B-ORG

's E-ORG

shares O
. O
I O
acknowledged O
that O
valuation O
of O
UVM B-ORG

's E-ORG

shares O
might O
not O
be O
an O
easy O
task O
, O
but O
this O
certainly O
did O
not O
mean O
that O
a O
zero O
value O
should O
be O
attributed O
to O
the O
shares O
. O
40 O
It O
was O
to O
me O
clear O
that O
Chemicals B-ORG

, E-ORG

MacNair S-ORG

and O
Emirates S-ORG

were O
related O
to O
the O
Applicants O
, O
and O
some O
discount O
had O
to O
be O
applied O
to O
their O
votes O
at O
the O
Scheme O
Meeting O
to O
take O
that O
into O
account O
, O
despite O
the O
difficulties O
in O
ascertaining O
the O
specific O
discount O
. O
In O
a O
situation O
such O
as O
the O
present O
, O
the O
court O
remained O
guided O
by O
general O
principles O
. O
At O
[ O
26 O
] O
above O
, O
it O
is O
stated O
that O
the O
reason O
why O
`` O
courts O
have O
consistently O
attributed O
less O
weight O
'' O
to O
the O
votes O
of O
related O
credits O
was O
because O
of O
the O
possibility O
that O
that O
a O
`` O
related O
party O
may O
have O
been O
motivated O
by O
personal O
or O
special O
interests O
to O
disregard O
the O
interests O
of O
the O
class O
as O
such O
and O
vote O
in O
a O
self-centred O
manner O
'' O
. O
Hence O
, O
in O
determining O
what O
the O
appropriate O
discount O
ought O
to O
be O
in O
a O
given O
case O
, O
the O
overarching O
question O
is O
to O
what O
extent O
a O
related O
creditor O
's O
voting O
decision O

: O
I O
can O
see O
no O
objection O
in O
principle O
to O
the O
court O
sanctioning O
a O
scheme O
which O
is O
conditional O
in O
one O
or O
more O
respects O
, O
provided O
always O
that O
the O
court O
considers O
it O
appropriate O
to O
do O
so O
in O
the O
exercise O
of O
its O
discretion O
. O
Examples O
of O
the O
kind O
of O
condition O
which O
the O
court O
may O
be O
willing O
to O
sanction O
, O
even O
if O
they O
are O
unsatisfied O
at O
the O
date O
of O
the O
hearing O
, O
are O
outstanding O
requirements O
for O
foreign O
regulatory O
approval O
which O
there O
is O
no O
reason O
to O
suppose O
will O
not O
be O
granted O
. O
Further O
, O
the O
terms O
of O
the O
scheme O
itself O
may O
provide O
that O
it O
will O
cease O
to O
have O
effect O
in O
certain O
circumstances O
, O
for O
example O
if O
the O
steps O
contemplated O
are O
not O
taken O
before O
a O
specified O
long-stop O
date O
. O
By O
contrast O
, O
the O
court O
would O
be O
most O
unlikely O
to O
sanction O
a O
scheme O
if O
the O
outstanding O
condition O
was O
one O
which O
in O
effect O
conferred O
on O
a O
third O
party O
the O
right O
to O
decide O
whether O
, O
or O
when O
, O
the O
scheme O
should O
come O
into O
operation O
, O
or O
which O
enabled O
the O
terms O
of O
the O
scheme O
to O
be O
varied O
in O
some O
material O
respect O
. O
The O
objection O
then O
would O
be O
that O
the O
court O
was O
not O
truly O
in O
a O
position O
to O
consider O
the O
merits O
of O
the O
scheme O
, O
so O
it O
could O
not O
properly O
exercise O
the O
jurisdiction O
conferred O
on O
it O
by O
Parliament S-ORG

to O
approve O
the O
scheme O
on O
behalf O
of O
all O
members O
of O
the O
relevant O
class O
or O
classes O
of O
shareholders O
. O
47 O
In O
my O
view O
, O
there O
was O
neither O
authority O
nor O
reason O
that O
a O
court O
must O
never O
sanction O
a O
scheme O
simply O
because O
it O
was O
contingent O
on O
some O
events O
occurring O
or O
not O
occurring O
. O
The O
focus O
of O
the O
analysis O
ought O
to O
be O
whether O
the O
scheme O
was O
sufficiently O
clear O
and O
certain O
so O
as O
to O
allow O

so O
uncertain O
or O
amorphous O
that O
it O
should O
not O
be O
approved O
. O
Much O
would O
depend O
on O
the O
structure O
of O
the O
proposed O
scheme O
and O
on O
the O
specific O
circumstances O
. O
That O
said O
, O
several O
common O
principles O
could O
be O
distilled O
from O
the O
authorities O
cited O
above O
and O
they O
provide O
general O
guidance O
: O
( O
a O
) O
A O
scheme O
ought O
not O
to O
be O
approved O
unless O
the O
creditors O
and O
the O
court O
can O
see O
very O
clearly O
at O
the O
time O
the O
scheme O
is O
proposed O
what O
it O
is O
that O
they O
are O
being O
asked O
to O
accept O
or O
approve O
. O
( O
b O
) O
A O
scheme O
containing O
machinery O
which O
could O
lead O
to O
variation O
of O
its O
terms O
is O
to O
be O
distinguished O
from O
the O
use O
of O
conditions O
subsequent O
to O
bring O
about O
termination O
of O
a O
scheme O
of O
arrangement O
. O
( O
i O
) O
In O
the O
former O
case O
, O
courts O
will O
generally O
not O
approve O
schemes O
which O
carry O
within O
themselves O
machinery O
for O
their O
own O
terms O
to O
be O
changed O
after O
they O
have O
received O
court O
approval O
. O
( O
ii O
) O
In O
the O
latter O
case O
, O
however O
, O
a O
scheme O
may O
provide O
for O
different O
results O
( O
including O
termination O
of O
the O
scheme O
) O
to O
emerge O
from O
different O
eventualities O
. O
This O
alone O
is O
no O
reason O
for O
a O
court O
to O
refuse O
to O
sanction O
the O
scheme O
, O
provided O
that O
the O
scheme O
clearly O
sets O
out O
what O
kind O
of O
results O
would O
follow O
on O
the O
occurrence O
of O
certain O
clearly O
defined O
events O
. O
48 O
In O
the O
present O
case O
, O
I O
was O
of O
the O
view O
that O
the O
proposed O
Scheme O
was O
sufficiently O
clear O
and O
certain O
. O
In O
particular O
, O
the O
proposed O
Scheme O
provided O
for O
failsafe O
payments O
in O
the O
event O
that O
the O
R O
& O
M O
did O
not O
accept O
the O
JEI O
Proposal O
, O
or O
on O
the O
expiry O
of O
one O
year O
from O
the O
date O
of O
commencement O
of O
the O
proposed O
Scheme O
. O
There O
was O
thus O
sufficient O
clarity O
and O
certainty O
as O
to O
what O
the O
proposed O
Scheme O
, O
at O
its O
minimum O
, O
would O
be O
. O
As O
for O
Clause O
2.3 O
, O
it O
was O
not O
to O
be O
construed O
as O
providing O
a O
machinery O
for O
a O
third O
party O
to O
change O
the O
terms O
of O
the O
scheme O
; O
it O
merely O
provided O
that O
the O
Applicants O
might O
propose O
a O
new O
scheme O
and O
might O
convene O
a O
creditors O
' O
meeting O
to O
vote O
on O
that O
new O
scheme O
. O
The O
creditors O
must O
still O
accept O
the O
newly O
proposed O
scheme O
before O
it O
could O
take O
effect O
. O
Whether O
the O
proposed O
Scheme O
was O
one O
which O
a O
reasonable O
creditor O
would O
approve O
49 O
I O
was O
further O
of O
the O
view O
that O
the O
proposed O
Scheme O
was O
not O
one O
that O
would O
not O
obtain O
any O
support O
from O
any O
reasonable O
creditor O
or O
voter O
. O
I O
noted O
that O
if O
the O
proposed O
Scheme O
did O
not O
succeed O
, O
the O
alternative O
course O
for O
the O
creditors O
would O
be O
to O
commence O
liquidation O
proceedings O
against O
the O
Applicants O
, O
in O
which O
case O
it O
would O
be O
uncertain O
as O
to O
how O
much O
of O
their O
debts O
they O
would O
be O
able O
to O
recover O
. O
This O
was O
because O
the O
Applicants O
had O
no O
underlying O
businesses O
and O
their O
primary O
asset O
was O
their O
shares O
in O
JAC S-ORG

which O
were O
pledged O
to O
the O
Senior O
Lenders O
and O
thus O
could O
not O
be O
unilaterally O
disposed O
of O
. O
In O
any O
event O
, O
JAC S-ORG

had O
been O
put O
under O
receivership O
and O
the O
value O
of O
its O

was O

In O
my O
view O

the O
statutory O
framework O

contemplates O
a O
conceptual O
distinction O
between O
the O
existence O
of O
an O

agreement O

its O
validity O
. O
Analogous O
to O
the O
exhortation O
made O
by O
the O
existentialist O
philosopher O
Jean-Paul B-OTHER_PERSON

Sartre E-OTHER_PERSON

that O
`` O
existence O
precedes O
essence O
'' O
, O
the O
existence O
of O
an O
arbitration O
agreement O
is O
a O
precondition O
to O
its O
legal O
validity O
. O
The O
questions O
in O
relation O
to O
the O
validity O
of O
an O
arbitration O
agreement O
concern O
the O
legal O
effect O
of O
an O
agreement O
, O
and O
whether O
the O
agreement O
is O
legally O
binding O
between O
the O
parties O
. O
When O
determining O
these O
questions O
, O
the O
existence O
of O
the O

is O
presupposed O
, O
without O
which O
no O

34 O
In O
conclusion O
, O
there O
is O
no O
doubt O
that O

be O
satisfied O

before O

is O
invoked O
. O
However O
, O
it O
is O
clear O
from O
the O
analysis O
above O
that O
the O
court O
only O
needs O
to O
be O
satisfied O
that O
an O
arbitration O
agreement O
exists O
on O
a O
prima O

level O
for O
the O
purposes O

establishing O
the O

under O
section B-PROVISION

( I-PROVISION

. E-PROVISION

This O
first O
precondition O
will O
not O
be O
met O
only O
in O
the O
clearest O
and O
most O
obvious O
of O
cases O
. O
This O
is O
not O
to O
say O
that O
the O
court O
should O
accept O
prima O
facie O
evidence O
of O
an O
arbitration O
agreement O
when O
it O
is O
clearly O
inconsistent O
with O
undisputed O
documentary O
and O
contemporaneous O
evidence O
, O
nor O
should O
the O
court O
accept O
uncritically O
every O
fact O
placed O
on O
the O
affidavits O
in O
support O
of O
the O
stay O
application O
. O
Nevertheless O
, O
based O
on O
the O
aforementioned O
reasons O
, O
there O
is O
no O
need O
for O
the O
court O
to O
descend O
into O
a O
protracted O
examination O
of O
the O
evidence O
to O
make O
a O
finding O
on O
the O
merits O
that O
an O
arbitration O
agreement O
exists O
on O
a O
balance O
of O
probabilities O
at O
the O

stage O
. O
With O
this O
, O
I O
turn O
my O
attention O
to O
determine O
whether O
an O
arbitration O
agreement O
exists O
in O
the O
present O

On O
the O

is O

At O
the O
hearing O

, O
counsel O
for O
Oceanic S-RESPONDENT

acknowledged O
that O
the O
security O
condition O
is O
a O
matter O
for O
the O
court O
's O
discretion O
, O
and O
did O
not O
provide O
any O
substantive O
arguments O
to O
persuade O
the O
court O
why O
the O
discretion O
should O
not O
be O
exercised O
in O
the O
plaintiff O
's O
favour O
. O
In O
view O
that O
the O
seat O
of O
the O
arbitration O
is O
in O
Singapore B-GPE

, E-GPE

I O
am O
of O
the O
view O
that O
it O
is O
both O
necessary O
and O
appropriate O
that O
the O
arrested O
vessel O
be O
retained O
as O
security O
in O
the O
satisfaction O
of O
any O
arbitral O
award O
given O
. O
The O
security O
condition O
is O
therefore O
allowed O
. O
45 O
With O
regard O
to O
the O
time-bar O
condition O
, O
the O
plaintiff O
made O
several O
arguments O
in O
relation O
to O
its O
alleged O
lack O
of O
knowledge O
of O
the O
existence O
of O
the O
demise O
charterparty O
and O
the O
time O
charterparty O
. O
According O
to O
the O
plaintiff O
, O
they O
knew O
about O
these O
two O
charterparties O
only O
after O
the O
time O
bar O
has O
apparently O
set O
in O
. O
The O
plaintiff O
relied O
on O
the O
two O
decisions O
, O
The O
`` O
Duden O
'' O
[ O
2008 O
] O
4 O
SLR O
( O
R O
) O
984 O
and O
The O
`` O
Xanadu O
'' O
[ O
1997 O
] O
3 O
SLR O
( O
R O
) O
360 O
in O
support O
of O
its O
position O
that O
the O
time-bar O
condition O
should O
be O
imposed O
. O
46 O
In O
my O
view O
, O
the O
two O
decisions O
submitted O
are O
not O
relevant O
in O
the O
present O
case O
. O
This O
is O
because O
even O
if O
the O
plaintiff O
knew O
about O
the O
charterparties O
before O
the O
time O
bar O
has O
apparently O
set O
in O
, O
the O
plaintiff O
's O
position O
is O
that O
the O
time O
bar O
does O
not O
apply O
in O
any O
event O
. O
The O
plaintiff O
takes O
the O
position O
that O
there O
is O
in O
fact O
no O
evidence O
to O
show O
that O
more O
than O
a O
year O
has O
elapsed O
since O
the O
cargo O
was O
completely O
discharged O
and O
delivered O
to O
third O
parties O
, O

As O

the O
alleged O
delivery O
of O
the O
cargo O
to O
the O

, O

is O
in O
contradiction O
with O
the O
sea-web O
searches O
conducted O
by O
the O
plaintiff O
that O
the O
said O
vessel O
does O
not O
even O
exist O
in O
the O
first O
place O
. O
The O
plaintiff O
highlighted O
the O
complete O
lack O
of O
evidence O
to O
show O
that O
the O
balance O
quantity O
of O
cargo O
( O
amounting O
to O
1,078 O
MT O
of O
fuel O
oil O
) O
has O
been O
delivered O
, O
and O
hence O
the O
lack O
of O
indication O
of O
when O
the O
one O
year O
time O
bar O
period O
had O
begun O
to O
run O
. O
In O
addition O
, O
the O
plaintiff O
pointed O
out O
that O
the O
face O
of O
the O
bills O
of O
lading O
state O
that O
the O
cargo O
was O
intended O
for O
delivery O
to O
`` O

, O
as O
opposed O
to O

not O

as O
well O
. O
Cases O
, O
both O
civil O
and O
criminal O
, O
often O
come O
before O
the O
courts O
. O
This O
is O
inevitable O
, O
indeed O
, O
necessary O
. O
There O
is O
a O
weighty O
public O
element O
involved O
. O
This O
public O
element O
is O
clearly O
present O
when O
it O
is O
decided O
to O
prosecute O
offenders O

It O
is O
also O
present O
in O
civil O
claims O
, O
although O
the O
primary O
area O
of O
law O
( O
principally O
with O
regard O
to O
tortious O
negligence O
) O
involves O
, O
on O
the O
face O
of O
things O
, O
individual O
claims O
and O
, O
hence O
, O
individual O
rights O
. O
This O
is O
due O
to O
the O
widespread O
nature O
of O
traffic O
accidents O
themselves O
. O
Other O
issues O
, O
besides O
liability O
between O
and O
amongst O
the O
parties O
, O
arise O
as O
a O
result O
. O
One O
such O
instance O
is O
the O
regulation O
of O
lawyers O
' O
fees O
, O
albeit O
, O
as O
we O
shall O
see O
, O
with O
a O

This O
, O
as O
we O
shall O
also O
see O
, O
constitutes O
the O
crux O
of O
the O

decision O

In O
so O
far O
as O
the O
issue O
of O
the O
regulation O
of O
lawyers O
' O
fees O
is O
concerned O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
note O
at O
the O
outset O
that O
the O
law O
is O
almost O
invariably O
about O
balance O
. O
Whilst O
lawyers O
perform O
an O
important O
, O
even O
laudable O
, O
function O
and O
ought O
therefore O
to O
be O
remunerated O
adequately O
for O
their O
efforts O
, O
as O
already O
alluded O
to O
above O
, O
the O
sheer O
number O
of O
traffic O
accidents O
introduces O
a O
not O
insignificant O
measure O
of O
public O
policy O
into O
the O
entire O

As O
I O
have O
pointed O

at O

such O

unfortunately O
- O
very O
commonplace O
in O

context O
. O
9 O
Indeed O
, O
this O
case O
involved O
precisely O
a O
claim O
arising O
out O
of O
a O
traffic O
accident O
involving O
a O
motor O
vehicle O
. O
The O
plaintiff O
was O
travelling O
as O
a O
pillion O
rider O
on O
a O
motorcycle O
ridden O
by O
the O
defendant O
and O
was O
injured O
as O
a O
result O
of O
a O
collision O
between O
the O
said O
motorcycle O
and O
a O
motor O
car O
. O
After O
the O
matter O
had O
been O
resolved O
( O
which O
involved O
interlocutory O
judgment O
against O
the O
defendant O
, O
followed O
by O
the O
assessment O
of O
damages O
) O
, O
there O
remained O
the O
issue O
of O
costs O
. O
The O
plaintiff O
had O
in O
fact O
engaged O
her O
own O
counsel O
, O
who O
is O
the O
applicant O
in O
the O
present O
proceedings O
. O
Unfortunately O
, O
the O

unable O
to O

10 O
Counsel O
for O

in O
fact O
vigorously O
opposed O
any O

upwards O
of O
the O

fixed O
by O
the O

On O
the O
contrary O
, O
he O
was O
of O
the O
view O
that O
they O
were O
in O

too O
high O

He O
also O
tendered O
specific O
arguments O
as O
to O
why O
I O
should O
dismiss O

I O
turn O
, O
however O
, O
to O
arguments O
by O

first O

I O
will O

all O

11 O
I O
only O
pause O
to O
add O
that O
although O
the O

was O
exceedingly O
straightforward O
, O
the O
various O
arguments O
made O
were O
extremely O
significant O
- O
if O

Indeed O
, O
counsel O
went O
so O
far O
as O
to O
argue O
that O
the O
presumption O
was O
conclusive O
and O
that O
the O
said O
agreement O
should O
govern O
these O
proceedings O
and O
that O
costs O
of O
$ O
40,000 O
should O
therefore O
be O
payable O
by O
the O
client O
to O
the O
firm O
, O
as O
agreed O
. O
16 O
I O
should O
add O
at O
this O
juncture O
that O
I O
detected O
no O
untoward O
motives O
in O
the O
applicant O
's O
argument O
. O
However O
, O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
applicant O
was O
under O
the O
clear O
impression O
that O
the O
argument O
centring O
on O
the O
presumption O
mentioned O
in O
the O
preceding O
paragraph O
was O
clearly O
correct O
makes O
it O
imperative O
that O
the O
argument O
itself O
should O
be O
analysed O
and O
ruled O
upon O
- O
if O
nothing O
else O
, O
because O
of O
the O
significant O
implications O
that O
arise O
from O
the O
sheer O
number O
of O
traffic O

that O
occur O

I O

that O

a O
situation O
where O
the O

in O

It O
is O
true O
that O
such O

might O
indicate O
that O
there O
was O
something O
amiss O
with O
the O
actual O
agreement O

the O

his O
or O
her O

. O
However O
, O
it O
does O
not O
seem O
to O
me O
to O
be O
practical O
to O
place O
the O
onus O
on O
the O
client O
to O
challenge O
the O
agreement O
when O
that O
agreement O
is O
in O
fact O
before O
the O
court O
in O
the O
first O
place O

Logic O
and O
common O
sense O
would O
suggest O
that O
the O
court O
ought O
to O
take O
the O
plain O
fact O
of O
the O
immense O
disparity O
into O
account O
when O
assessing O
what O
costs O
ought O
to O
be O
paid O
by O
the O
client O
to O
his O
or O
her O
solicitor O
- O
rather O
than O
allow O
the O
client O
to O
raise O
this O
point O
in O
perhaps O
a O
separate O
action O
. O
Indeed O
, O
one O
ought O
to O
bear O
in O
mind O
the O
fact O
that O
most O
clients O
are O
- O
apart O
from O
the O
wise O
counsel O
provided O
by O
their O
own O
solicitors O
- O
wholly O
ignorant O
of O
the O
law O
( O
interestingly O
, O
I O
note O
the O
following O
( O
and O
only O
) O
statement O
which O
apparently O
issued O
from O
the O
plaintiff O

lips O
during O
the O

the O
learned O
assistant O

, O
which O
was O
this O
: O
`` O

'' O
) O
. O
In O
the O
nature O
of O
things O
, O
the O
solicitor O
concerned O
could O
hardly O
be O
expected O
to O
advise O
the O
client O
as O
to O
whether O
or O
not O
the O
costs O
that O
very O
solicitor O
seeks O
is O
too O
high O
, O
no O
matter O
how O
well-meaning O
that O
solicitor O
might O
subjectively O
be O
. O
This O
is O
why O
, O
as O
I O
have O
mentioned O
, O
the O

has O
little O
choice O

to O
decide O
the O
issue O

: O
The O
Act O
protects O
the O
interest O
of O
claimants O
by O
requiring O
lawyers O
acting O
on O
behalf O
of O
claimants O
to O
submit O
their O
charges O
to O
the O
courts O
for O
scrutiny O
. O
This O
is O
to O
ensure O
that O
the O
lawyers O
' O
charges O
are O
fair O
and O
reasonable O
. O
The O
Bill O
makes O
two O
adjustments O
to O
this O
system O
. O
First O
, O
the O
Bill O
makes O
it O
unnecessary O
for O
a O
lawyer O
to O
submit O
his O
charges O
for O
scrutiny O
by O
the O
courts O
if O
the O
Public O
Trustee O
agrees O
with O
the O
charges O
. O
This O
will O
result O
in O
savings O
in O
time O
and O
resources O
for O
the O
courts O
and O
the O
lawyers O
involved O
. O
Second O
, O
the O
Bill O
allows O
the O
Public O
Trustee O
to O
decide O
what O
charges O
the O
lawyer O
should O
claim O
if O
the O
lawyer O
fails O
to O
submit O
his O
charges O
for O
court O
scrutiny O
within O
three O
months O
after O
the O
compensation O
amount O
has O
been O
approved O
by O
the O
Public O
Trustee O
or O
fixed O
by O
a O
court O
. O
Delay O
by O
a O
lawyer O
in O
submitting O
his O
charges O
for O
court O
scrutiny O
means O
delay O
in O
the O
payment O
of O
compensation O
to O
his O
client O
. O
This O
is O
unfair O
to O
the O
client O
. O
The O
Bill O
also O
empowers O
the O
Public O
Trustee O
to O
appear O
and O
argue O
in O
any O
court O
case O
involving O
a O
claim O
of O
compensation O
for O
personal O
injury O
arising O
from O
traffic O
accident O
. O
This O
will O
give O
the O
Public O
Trustee O
greater O
flexibility O
in O
fulfilling O
his O
role O
of O
protecting O
the O
interests O
of O
persons O
claiming O
such O
compensation O
. O

The O
legislative O
intention O
is O
clear O
. O
It O
is O
to O
ensure O
that O
claimants O
or O
plaintiffs O
are O
protected O
and O
that O
they O
pay O
their O

solicitors O
only O
such O

As O
we O
have O
already O
seen O
above O
( O
at O

) O
, O
it O
used O
to O
be O
the O
situation O
that O
all O
charges O
so O
payable O
were O
subject O
to O

and O
that O
, O
to O
alleviate O
the O

, O
an O

The O

were O

as O

if O
the O

agreed O

the O

This O

the O

The O

such O
that O
the O

. O
In O
fact O
, O
the O
market O
survey O
commissioned O
by O
the O
plaintiff O
indicated O
that O
45 O
% O
of O
the O
plaintiff O

recent O
customers O
thought O
that O
the O
two O
products O
looked O
like O

70 O

The O
instruction O

inside O
the O
plaintiff O

appeared O
to O
have O
been O
copied O

by O

Indeed O
, O
where O
the O
Chinese O
version O
of O
the O

was O
concerned O
, O
six O
typographical O
errors O
made O
by O
the O

repeated O
by O
the O

The O
defendant O
produced O
no O
evidence O
to O
show O
that O
his O
packaging O
and O

had O
been O
developed O
independently O
. O
He O
claimed O
that O
contractual O
documents O

The O
plaintiff O

would O
not O
be O

Therefore O
, O
every O

the O

The O
defendant O
explained O
that O
the O

it O
was O
the O
name O

refused O
to O
do O
so O
as O
that O
would O
have O
been O
tantamount O
to O
falsification O

. O
He O
asked O
the O
defendant O
for O
one O
night O
to O
think O
it O
over O

That O
night O
, O
he O
telephoned O
the O

asked O
for O
$ O
75,000 O
in O
return O
for O
doing O
what O
was O
requested O
of O
him O
. O
This O
was O
the O
way O
of O
escape O
for O
Ivan S-OTHER_PERSON

as O
he O
knew O
that O
the O

would O
not O
be O
able O

pay O
him O
that O

His O

He O
denied O
that O
he O
was O
pressurizing O
the O
defendant O
to O
buy O
him O
over O
as O
a O
witness O
, O
failing O
which O
he O
would O
testify O
for O
the O
plaintiff O
for O
reward O
, O
as O
he O
was O
aware O
that O
doing O
such O
things O
would O
land O
him O
in O
trouble O
with O
the O

did O
not O
accept O
his O
demand O
for O
$ O

The O

told O

fixed O

Ivan S-OTHER_PERSON

not O
enquire O

A O
few O

Ivan B-OTHER_PERSON

a O

asked O
the O
defendant O
for O
$ O
75,000 O
again O
or O
he O
would O
testify O
against O
him O
. O
He O
claimed O
that O
it O
was O
just O
to O
start O
an O
argument O
and O
create O
an O
excuse O
for O
him O
to O
leave O
the O

which O
he O
did O
soon O

He O
denied O

sabotage O
the O

47 O
Some O
time O
later O
, O
Ivan S-OTHER_PERSON

decided O

He O
adopted O
everything O
that O
Ivan S-OTHER_PERSON

said O
in O
his O
affidavit O
of O
evidence-in-chief O
except O
for O
the O
contention O
that O
the O

had O
requested O
Ivan S-OTHER_PERSON

to O
issue O
false O
receipts O

of O
which O
he O
had O
no O
knowledge O

49 O
Patrick S-OTHER_PERSON

said O
that O
when O
people O
approached O
them O
and O
asked O
whether O
the O

they O
were O
selling O
was O
an O
OTO O

, O
they O
would O
say O
that O
it O

that O
it O

a O

Their O
machine O
was O
therefore O
worth O
buying O

The O
defendant O
instructed O
him O
to O
sell O
their O
machine O
as O
something O
different O
from O
the O
OTO O

he O
did O
so O

They O
left O

the O

Because O
of O
the O

the O

His O

the O

they O
would O
emphasise O
its O

56 O
The O

his O

the O

His O

It O

Where O
the O

, O
the O
defendant O
claimed O
that O
the O

It O
suggested O
that O
the O

The O

The O

that O
his O

not O
represent O
his O

the O

the O
superior O

better O
price O
of O
the O
HL1016 O

In O

, O
he O
relied O
on O
the O
`` O

name O
and O
not O
the O

His O

added O

he O

He O

lowered O

It O
was O
too O
much O
of O
a O

that O
the O

had O
the O

first O
two O

a O

the O

`` O

and O

stripes O

fact O
that O
the O

while O
the O
defendant O

`` O
OTC O
'' O
was O
not O
did O
not O
make O
a O
significant O
difference O
in O
the O
overall O
visual O
impact O
. O
Anyone O
looking O
at O
the O
defendant O

mark O
without O
close O
scrutiny O
, O
whether O
due O
to O
distance O
or O
the O
shortness O
of O
time O
, O
would O
have O
thought O
that O
he O
had O
seen O
the O
letters O
`` O

'' O
. O
It O
did O
not O
matter O
that O
the O
defendant O

had O
other O
words O
below O
it O
. O
The O
top O
three O
letters O
were O
in O
bold O
print O

they O
were O
the O
ones O
that O
were O
distinctive O
and O
that O
would O
register O
immediately O
on O
the O
viewer O
. O
The O
use O
of O
what O
appeared O
to O
be O
`` O
OTO O
'' O
as O
a O
distinct O
word O
, O
with O
or O
without O
additional O
words O
or O
material O
, O
amounted O
to O
infringement O
in O
much O
the O

way O
as O

held O

The O
defendant O

was O
therefore O
similar O
to O
the O
plaintiff O

`` O

'' O
. O
I O
should O
add O
that O
I O
found O
the O
defendant O

explanation O
as O
to O
how O
he O
coined O
the O
name O
`` O

' O
rather O
contrived O
in O
the O
light O
of O
all O
the O
other O
similarities O
his O
mark O
shared O
with O
the O
plaintiff O
's O
trademark O
and O
the O
unregistered O
mark O
. O
79 O
The O
plaintiff O
's O
trademark O
was O
registered O
for O
massage O
apparatus O
and O
the O
defendant O
's O
mark O
was O
used O
for O
massage O
apparatus O
, O
in O
particular O
, O
foot O
massager O
. O
The O
defendant O
had O
therefore O
used O
a O
sign O
which O
was O
similar O
to O
the O
plaintiff O
's O
trademark O
and O
in O
relation O
to O
identical O
goods O
for O
which O
the O
plaintiff O
's O
trademark O
was O
registered O
. O
80 O
The O
plaintiff O
had O
to O
prove O
only O
likelihood O
of O
confusion O
and O
not O
actual O
confusion O
. O
The O
plaintiff O
relied O
on O
the O
case O
of O
MI O
& O
M O
Corporation O
v O
A O
Mohamed O
Ibrahim O
[ O
1964 O
] O
MLJ O
392 O
where O
the O
court O
applied O
the O
test O
of O
imperfect O
recollection O
and O
said O
that O
, O
`` O
In O
the O
present O
case O
the O
test O
is O
to O
be O
applied O
in O
relation O
to O
people O
who O
are O
generally O
illiterate O
and O
who O
do O
their O
shopping O
in O
small O
dark O
grocers O
' O
shops O
where O
large O
quantities O
of O
goods O
are O
crowded O
in O
a O
disorderly O
manner O
'' O
. O
The O
plaintiff O
submitted O
that O
the O
atrium O
of O
Sim O
Lim O
Square O
was O
a O
noisy O
, O
bustling O
area O
with O
many O
stalls O
and O
shoppers O
and O
where O
the O
majority O
of O
customers O
buying O
the O
massage O
machine O
were O
`` O
uncles O
and O
aunties O
'' O
( O
or O
middle-aged O
and O
elderly O
people O
) O
, O
who O
were O
likely O
to O
be O
less O
educated O
and O
more O
likely O
to O
mistake O
the O
defendant O
's O
machine O
for O
the O
plaintiff O
's O
. O
It O
was O
argued O
therefore O
that O
the O
test O
mentioned O
in O
the O
case O
cited O
above O
was O
highly O
relevant O
for O
the O
present O
case O
. O
81 O
In O
this O
case O
, O
`` O
OTO O
'' O
is O
, O
phonetically O
and O
visually O
, O
a O
very O
simple O
word O
which O
the O
literate O
and O
illiterate O
could O
easily O
remember O
. O
It O
was O
certainly O
very O
much O
more O
well O
known O
than O
the O
defendant O
's O
`` O
OTC O
'' O
. O
It O
was O
obviously O
for O
this O
reason O
that O
the O
defendant O
chose O
a O
name O
that O
could O
be O
deceptively O
presented O
to O
resemble O
`` O
OTO O
'' O
. O
It O
did O
not O
matter O
whether O
the O
potential O
customers O
were O
well O
educated O
or O
not O
, O
and O
the O
atrium O
in O
Sim O
Lim O
Square O
could O
hardly O
be O
described O
as O
dark O
or O
dingy O
. O
What O
was O
important O
was O
whether O
they O
would O
think O
they O
saw O
`` O
OTO O
'' O
when O
the O
letters O
were O
actually O
`` O
OTC O
'' O
disguised O
to O
look O
like O
`` O
OTO O
'' O
. O
An O
objective O
test O
should O
be O
applied O
here O
. O
There O
could O
be O
little O
doubt O
objectively O
that O
confusion O
was O
likely O
in O
the O
circumstances O
of O
this O
case O
. O
Further O
, O
it O
appeared O
that O
a O
good O
number O
of O
people O
were O
actually O
confused O
by O
the O
cleverly O
disguised O
word O
as O
they O
had O
to O
ask O
the O
sales O
staff O
whether O
the O
machine O
was O
`` O
OTO O
'' O
. O
Once O
there O
was O
a O
likelihood O
of O
confusion O
, O
infringement O
had O
taken O
place O
and O
it O
did O
not O
matter O
that O
the O
defendant O
's O
sales O
staff O
then O
tried O
to O
explain O
that O
their O
product O
was O
not O
`` O
OTO O
'' O
. O
In O
any O
event O
, O
the O
sales O
staff O
did O
not O
help O
much O
on O
some O
occasions O
as O
they O
were O
enjoying O
themselves O
by O
playing O
on O
the O
phonetic O
similarity O
between O
`` O
OTO O
'' O
and O
`` O
auto O
'' O
, O
thereby O
confounding O
instead O
of O
expounding O
. O
It O
also O
did O
not O
matter O
if O
no O
sale O
took O
place O
because O
the O
defendant O
had O
already O
used O
someone O
else O
's O
trademark O
as O
a O
bait O
to O
bring O
in O
customers O
. O
82 O
The O
plaintiff O
therefore O
succeeded O
in O
its O
claim O
on O
infringement O
of O
its O
trademark O
, O
`` O
OTO O
'' O
. O
83 O
The O
plaintiff O
also O
claimed O
passing O
off O
in O
respect O
of O
the O
defendant O
's O
use O
of O
the O
words O
`` O
OTO O
Bodycare O
'' O
and O
`` O
Electro-Relaxologist O
'' O
, O
the O
similarities O
in O
shape O
, O
design O
, O
packaging O
and O
overall O
get-up O
between O
the O
defendant O
's O
HL1016 O
machine O
and O
the O
plaintiff O
's O
ER839 O
machine O
. O
The O
plaintiff O
argued O
that O
the O
defendant O
's O
machine O
was O
an O
instrument O
of O
deception O
and O
that O
the O
sales O
methodology O
of O
the O
defendant O
confused O
the O
public O
into O
purchasing O
his O
machine O
as O
and O
for O
the O
plaintiff O
's O
. O
Following O
from O
this O
, O
it O
was O
submitted O
that O
the O
removal O
of O
the O
word O
`` O
Electro-Relaxologist O
'' O
would O
not O
materially O
lessen O
or O
remove O
the O
likelihood O
of O
confusion O
and O
deception O
of O
the O
public O
if O
the O
sales O
methodology O
remained O
the O
same O
. O
84 O
To O
succeed O
in O
a O
passing-off O
claim O
, O
the O
plaintiff O
had O
to O
show O
that O
it O
had O
the O
necessary O
goodwill O
, O
that O
there O
was O
misrepresentation O
by O
the O
defendant O
and O
that O
damages O
were O
suffered O
as O
a O
result O
. O
The O
plaintiff O
asserted O
that O
goodwill O
arose O
from O
trading O
and O
could O
attach O
to O
trade O
names O
as O
well O
as O
the O
get O
up O
, O
including O
the O
form O
factor O
, O
of O
the O
product O
. O
Goodwill O
is O
the O
benefit O
and O
advantage O
of O
the O
good O
name O
, O
reputation O
and O
connection O
of O
a O

86 O
Clearly O

the O

intended O

The O

too O
striking O

the O
shape O
and O
get O
up O
of O
the O
plaintiff O
's O
massage O
machine O
and O
the O
plaintiff O
's O
sales O
method O
were O
concerned O
. O
The O
plaintiff O
was O
not O
claiming O
it O
had O
a O
monopoly O
on O
the O
design O
of O
the O
massage O
machine O
or O
its O
sales O
methodology O
( O
which O
did O
not O
appear O
to O
me O
particularly O
unique O
in O
any O
case O
) O
. O
The O
defendant O
's O
packaging O
box O
, O
while O
having O
similarities O
with O
the O
plaintiff O
's O
, O
nevertheless O
had O
enough O
visual O
differences O
to O
distinguish O
itself O
from O
the O
plaintiff O
's O
. O
The O
public O
's O
usual O
question O
about O
whether O
the O
defendant O
's O
machine O
was O
an O
OTO O
product O
was O
probably O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
people O
were O
more O
familiar O
with O
the O
OTO O
name O
, O
which O
had O
been O
advertised O
extensively O
, O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
defendant O
had O
used O
a O
term O
which O
looked O
like O
`` O
OTO O
'' O
, O
rather O
than O
due O
to O
their O
instant O
recognition O
of O
the O
design O
and O
shape O
of O
the O
machine O
. O
I O
therefore O
found O
that O
it O
was O
not O
proved O
that O
the O
plaintiff O
possessed O
goodwill O
and O
reputation O
in O
`` O
Electro-Reflexologist O
'' O
or O
in O
the O
shape O
, O
design O
and O
sales O
methodology O
of O
its O
product O
although O
I O
accepted O
the O
plaintiff O
's O
arguments O
that O
the O
defendant O
was O
a O
copycat O
in O
many O
aspects O
. O
88 O
Accordingly O
, O
passing O
off O
occurred O
so O
long O
as O
the O
defendant O
used O
`` O
OTC O
'' O
or O
`` O
OTC O
Bodycare O
'' O
in O
the O
way O
he O
did O
. O
Once O
those O
terms O
were O
removed O
from O
his O
posters O
and O
flyers O
, O
the O
passing O
off O
ceased O
. O
The O
evidence O
showed O
that O
the O
defendant O
stopped O
using O
those O
terms O
by O

by O
the O

I O
therefore O
held O
that O

the O

situation O

he O
created O
the O
said O
Notice O
of O
Agreement O
( O
see O
[ O

above O
) O
. O
The O
defendant O
tried O
to O
explain O
why O
he O
prepared O
that O
notice O
. O
It O
was O
to O
serve O
two O
purposes O
, O
he O
said O
. O
The O
first O
purpose O
was O
to O
inform O
the O
public O
that O
he O
was O
allowed O
to O
sell O
his O
product O
( O
ie O
there O
was O
no O
restraint O
by O
injunction O
) O
. O
This O
was O
because O
there O
were O
rumours O
in O
the O
market O
that O
no O
one O
was O
allowed O
to O
sell O
that O
product O
. O
The O
second O
purpose O
was O
to O
show O
that O
the O
holder O
of O
that O
`` O
certificate O
'' O
had O
been O
granted O
dealer O
status O
by O
him O
. O
If O
the O
plaintiff O
were O
to O
bully O
his O
sales O
staff O
by O
threatening O
legal O
action O
against O
them O
, O
they O
could O
rely O
on O
the O
certificate O
and O
point O
their O
fingers O
at O
him O
. O
Here O
again O
, O
I O
found O
the O
defendant O
's O
explanation O
to O
be O
contrived O
. O
Far O
from O
accomplishing O
those O
purported O
purposes O
, O
the O
said O
notice O
, O
when O
viewed O
objectively O
by O
a O
member O
of O
the O
public O
, O
strongly O
suggested O
that O
the O
defendant O
or O
the O
holder O
of O
the O
notice O
had O
been O
appointed O
a O
dealer O
of O
the O
plaintiff O
's O
goods O
and O
that O
what O
he O
was O
selling O
was O
therefore O
an O
`` O
OTO O
'' O
product O
. O
It O
was O
another O
manifestation O
of O
his O
youthful O
mischief O
and O
defiance O
and O
corrupted O
creativity O
. O
By O
instructing O
his O
sales O
staff O
to O
place O
that O
notice O
next O
to O
the O
product O
they O
were O
selling O
at O
Sim O
Lim O
Square O
and O
to O
carry O
it O
with O
them O
for O
their O
sales O
rounds O
, O
he O
revived O
the O
passing O
off O
. O
90 O
For O
this O
reason O
, O
while O
I O
found O
no O
infringement O
of O

the O
counterclaim O

It O
was O
incredible O
that O
Ryan S-OTHER_PERSON

would O
be O
willing O
to O
take O
over O
the O
business O
and O
be O
able O
to O
obtain O
stocks O
of O
the O

almost O
immediately O

If O
there O
were O
rumours O
flying O
in O
the O
market O
that O
no O
one O
was O
to O
sell O
the O
HL1016 O
, O
as O
claimed O
by O
the O

, O
then O
surely O
Ryan S-OTHER_PERSON

would O
have O
known O
about O
the O
rumours O
and O
made O
some O
enquiries O
before O
taking O
over O
the O
business O
. O
At O
the O
very O
least O
, O
Ryan S-OTHER_PERSON

would O
be O
curious O
to O
know O
why O
the O
defendant O
was O
suddenly O
giving O
up O
something O
which O
appeared O
profitable O
. O
It O
was O
equally O
unbelievable O
that O
Ryan S-OTHER_PERSON

would O
, O
in O
turn O
, O
relinquish O
the O
business O
and O
hand O
it O
back O
to O
the O

once O
the O
committal O

. O
Although O
Ivan B-OTHER_PERSON

evidence O
should O
be O
scrutinised O
and O
treated O
with O
caution O
because O
of O
his O
attempts O
to O
extract O
payment O
from O
the O
defendant O
, O
I O
was O
persuaded O
he O
was O
telling O
the O
truth O
. O
His O
evidence O
and O
Patrick B-WITNESS

's E-WITNESS

testimony O
showed O
, O
without O
a O
doubt O
, O
that O
the O
defendant O
was O
still O
their O
employer O
after O
5 B-DATE

March I-DATE

and O
that O
Ryan/JIT S-ORG

was O
just O
a O
stand-in O
for O
the O
defendant O
. O
The O
defendant O
did O
not O
call O
Ryan S-OTHER_PERSON

as O
a O
witness O
to O
corroborate O
his O
evidence O
. O
If O
the O
reason O
for O
not O
doing O
so O
was O
that O
he O
had O
fallen O
out O
with O
Ryan B-OTHER_PERSON

, E-OTHER_PERSON

stated O

it O

from O
Ryan S-OTHER_PERSON

with O
such O
ease O

93 O
Counsel O
for O
the O
defendant O
argued O
that O
the O
interim O
injunction O
obtained O
by O
the O
plaintiff O
should O
be O
discharged O
on O
two O
grounds O
. O
The O
first O
ground O
was O
that O
the O
plaintiff O
had O
failed O
to O
disclose O
the O
first O
private O
investigator O
's O
report O
which O
was O
already O
in O
existence O
at O
the O
time O
of O
application O
to O
court O
. O
That O
report O
would O
have O
shown O
that O
the O
defendant O
's O
sales O
staff O
differentiated O
the O
HL1016 O
from O
the O
plaintiff O
's O
ER839 O
. O
The O
second O
ground O
relied O
on O
was O
that O
the O
plaintiff O
had O
pleaded O
in O
February B-DATE

2004 E-DATE

that O
`` O
OTO O
Bodycare O
'' O
was O
a O
registered O
trademark O
and O
claimed O
that O
infringement O
thereof O
. O
That O
was O
not O
rectified O
until O
early O
2005 S-DATE

by O
an O
amendment O
to O
the O
Statement O
of O
Claim O
. O
94 O
The O
plaintiff O
ought O
to O
have O
been O
much O
more O
careful O
in O
its O
pleading O
and O
in O
its O
application O
to O
court O
for O
an O
injunction O
. O
However O
, O
the O
defendant O
could O
also O
have O
applied O
to O
court O
to O
set O
aside O
or O
vary O
the O
injunction O
at O
an O
early O
stage O
. O
He O
did O
not O
. O
Instead O
of O
setting O
aside O
or O
varying O
the O
interim O
injunction O
at O
this O
very O
late O
stage O
, O
I O
would O
take O
into O
consideration O
the O
plaintiff O
's O
errors O
in O
my O
decision O
on O
the O
costs O
of O
these O
proceedings O

95 O
Counsel O
for O
the O

The O

that O

that O

be O
awarded O
to O
him O
for O
that O
period O
. O
I O
did O
not O
accept O
the O
defendant O

argument O
. O
Firstly O
, O
the O
plaintiff O
was O
right O
not O
to O
have O
withdrawn O
its O
claims O
in O
respect O
of O
the O
two O
periods O
that O
I O
have O
indicated O
earlier O
. O
Secondly O
, O
the O
Offer O
to O
Settle O
contained O
several O
other O
terms O
such O
as O
the O
plaintiff O
having O
to O
pay O
costs O
and O
reasonable O
compensation O
to O
the O
defendant O
, O
which O
, O
as O
events O
have O
shown O
, O
were O
unjustifiable O
terms O
. O
96 O
On O
my O
findings O
, O
there O
was O
infringement O
and/or O
passing O
off O
and O
an O
injunction O
should O
be O
granted O
to O
restrain O
the O
defendant O
from O
infringing O
the O
plaintiff O

or O
from O

the O

I O

I O
also O
granted O
judgment O

the O
plaintiff O
for O
damages O

the O

the O
fact O
that O
the O

The O
question O
of O
whether O
an O
estoppel O
can O
operate O
so O
as O
to O
contradict O
the O
purpose O
of O
a O
statutory O

is O
bound O
up O
with O
the O
question O
of O
whether O
parties O
can O
by O
an O
express O
contract O
remove O
the O
effect O
of O
a O
statutory O
provision O
( O
what O
is O
sometimes O
called O
'contracting O
out O
' O
of O
the O
provision O
) O
. O
It O
is O
generally O
correct O
to O
say O
that O
if O
a O
statutory O
provision O
can O
not O
be O
overridden O
by O
agreement O
then O
equally O
the O
effect O
of O
the O
provision O
can O
not O
be O
removed O
as O
a O
result O
of O
an O
estoppel O
. O
Accordingly O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
its O
relationship O
to O
statutory O
provisions O
, O
estoppel O
can O
not O
be O
considered O
in O
isolation O
but O
is O
often O
bound O
up O
with O
the O
wider O
question O
of O
whether O
a O

provision O
can O
be O
deprived O
of O
its O
effect O
by O
an O

For O

, O
I O
find O
that O
there O
are O
special O
circumstances O
that O
justify O
allowing O

. O
Primarily O
, O
the O
issue O
of O
whether O
the O

are O
`` O

'' O
within O
the O
meaning O
of O
s O
176 O
( O
1 O
) O
is O
not O
without O
merit O
. O
In O
fact O
, O
from O
the O
parties O
' O
detailed O
submissions O
on O
the O
issues O
raised O
, O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
OA B-CASE_NUMBER

218 E-CASE_NUMBER

involved O
a O
real O
issue O
of O
concern O
that O
a O
court O
should O
legitimately O
decide O
. O
It O
would O
be O
quite O
different O
if O
OA B-CASE_NUMBER

218 E-CASE_NUMBER

were O
devoid O
of O
merit O
. O
In O
that O
case O
, O
it O
would O
be O
easier O
for O
the O
Requisitionists O
to O
portray O
it O
as O
an O
abuse O
of O
process O
. O
Moreover O
, O
the O
question O
of O
whether O
the O
Requisitionists O
are O
`` O
members O
'' O
or O
not O
does O
involve O
the O
public O
interest O
. O
This O
is O
since O
the O
effect O
of O
any O
exercise O
of O
a O
member O
's O
right O
to O
requisition O
a O
meeting O
would O
affect O
all O
other O

as O
well O

As O
such O
, O
there O

a O
legitimate O
, O

limited O
, O
public O
interest O
in O
OA B-CASE_NUMBER

being O
heard O
and O
decided O
. O
61 O
Third O
, O
and O
perhaps O
more O
fundamentally O
, O
I O
am O
doubtful O
whether O
the O
extended O
doctrine O
of O
res O
judicata O
would O
apply O
to O
allow O
the O
parties O
to O
deviate O
from O
a O
statutory O
provision O
that O
is O
imperative O
in O
nature O
. O
It O
would O
be O
odd O
if O
the O
Requisitionists O
could O
obtain O
this O
outcome O
through O
the O
extended O
doctrine O
of O
res O
judicata O
when O
it O
is O
disallowed O
through O
the O
conventional O
estoppels O
. O
Given O
that O
the O
effect O
of O
the O
extended O
doctrine O
of O
res O
judicata O
is O
substantially O
the O
same O
as O
an O
estoppel O
, O
allowing O
the O
extended O
doctrine O
of O
res O
judicata O
to O
apply O
here O
would O
be O
legally O
incoherent O
, O
despite O
the O
admittedly O
different O
juridical O
bases O
of O
the O
doctrines O
. O
As O
such O
, O
for O
the O
reasons O
I O
have O
explained O
above O
as O
to O
why O
I O
do O
not O
think O

can O

I O

62 O

I O
conclude O
that O

conduct O
in O
relation O
to O
the O
intended O
EGM O
, O
it O
is O
also O
not O
appropriate O
to O
make O
bad O
law O
in O
any O
case O
, O
let O
alone O
a O
hard O
case O
. O
While O
it O
may O
be O
tempting O
to O
say O
that O
the O
`` O
justice O
'' O
of O
the O
case O
requires O
a O
different O
outcome O
, O
it O
is O
also O
important O
that O
such O
recourse O
to O
`` O
justice O
'' O
does O
not O
detract O
from O
a O
proper O
and O
rigorous O
analysis O
of O
the O
facts O
and O
law O
. O
Indeed O
, O
it O
should O
be O
recognised O
that O
there O
are O
different O
facets O
to O
`` O
justice O
'' O
. O
The O
maintenance O
of O
a O
coherent O
fabric O
of O
the O
law O
, O
which O
can O
be O
applied O
consistently O
and O
with O
certainty O
in O
case O
after O
case O
, O
is O
also O
an O
important O
consideration O
. O
That O
said O
, O
coherence O
can O
not O
be O
pursued O
at O
the O
cost O
of O
grave O
injustice O
in O
an O
instant O
case O
. O
Therefore O
, O
the O
balance O
of O
justice O
in O
each O
case O
must O
be O
weighed O
carefully O
and O
objectively O
with O
especial O
regard O
to O
the O
specific O
facts O
. O
The O
recourse O
to O
`` O
justice O
'' O
requires O
such O
in O
every O
case O
. O
In O
the O
present O
case O
, O
the O
need O
to O
maintain O
coherence O
in O
the O
fabric O
of O
the O
law O
is O
balanced O
against O
the O
fact O
that O
my O
decision O
does O
not O
bar O
the O
Requisitionists O
from O

that O

Indeed O
, O
when O
I O
asked O
Ms B-LAWYER

how O
Tanoto S-PETITIONER

knows O
that O
the O
CAD O
had O
begun O
investigations O
against O
the O
Requisitionists O
, O
she O
said O
that O
her O
instructions O
are O
that O
Tanoto S-PETITIONER

said O
that O
Mr B-OTHER_PERSON

Ng E-OTHER_PERSON

had O
informed O
him O
that O
he O
( O

received O
a O
call O
from O

that O
they O
were O
investigating O

. O
I O
find O
this O
entire O
account O
unbelievable O
. O
If O
, O
as O
Tanoto S-PETITIONER

says O
, O
the O
entire O
premise O
of O
OA B-CASE_NUMBER

156 E-CASE_NUMBER

rests O
on O
the O
investigations O
, O
I O
find O
it O
hard O
to O
account O
for O
why O
he O
did O
not O
include O
such O
an O
important O
point O
in O
his O
affidavit O
. O
Moreover O
, O
it O
was O
only O
upon O
my O
questioning O
that O
Ms B-LAWYER

Neo E-LAWYER

gave O
me O
the O
answer O
- O
during O
the O
hearing O
itself O
- O
about O
how O
Mr B-OTHER_PERSON

Ng E-OTHER_PERSON

was O
informed O
by O
the O
CAD S-ORG

of O
the O
pending O
investigations O
, O
which O
is O
, O
of O
course O
, O
conveniently O
not O
documented O
. O
The O
fact O
is O
that O
there O
is O
simply O
no O
credible O
evidence O
which O
shows O
that O
there O
are O
ongoing O
investigations O
against O
the O
Requisitionists O
. O
78 O
For O
these O
reasons O
, O
I O
find O
that O
Tanoto S-PETITIONER

has O
not O
shown O
that O
there O
are O
current O
ongoing O
investigations O
against O
the O
Requisitionists O
. O
Without O
such O
investigations O
, O
Tanoto S-PETITIONER

can O
not O
even O
begin O
to O
show O
how O

has O
any O
reason O
to O
seek O
an O
injunction O
against O
the O

. O
This O
alone O
suffices O
for O
me O
to O
conclude O
that O
Tanoto B-PETITIONER

is O
not O

action O
. O
80 O
Considering O
this O
, O
I O
do O
not O
think O
that O
Tanoto S-PETITIONER

has O
a O
reasonable O
belief O
that O
a O
good O
action O
exists O
. O
As O
I O
have O
said O
, O
Tanoto S-PETITIONER

is O
effectively O
seeking O
a O
permanent O
injunction O
to O
restrain O
the O
Requisitionists O
from O
ever O
requisitioning O
for O
an O
EGM O
. O
To O
my O
mind O
, O
this O
is O
patently O
unreasonable O
because O
Tanoto S-PETITIONER

has O
not O
shown O
credible O
evidence O
that O
warrant O
such O
a O
draconian O
outcome O
. O
81 O
First O
, O
Tanoto S-PETITIONER

points O
out O
that O
the O
Requisitionists O
may O
have O
obtained O
their O
shares O
in O
an O
improper O
and O
pre-arranged O
manner O
. O
Be O
that O
as O
it O
may O
, O
as O
I O
have O
already O
explained O
, O
even O
on O
Tanoto B-PETITIONER

own O
case O
, O
investigations O
into O
this O
matter O
are O
currently O
ongoing O
. O
If O
there O
is O
no O
conclusive O
determination O
at O
this O
time O
, O
I O
can O
hardly O
see O
how O
a O
permanent O
injunction O
against O
the O
Requisitionists O
can O
rest O
on O
this O
matter O
. O
In O
any O
event O
, O
for O
the O
reasons O
above O
, O
I O
am O
not O
even O
sure O
that O
there O
are O
any O
ongoing O
investigations O
against O
the O

Second O
, O
Tanoto S-PETITIONER

says O
that O
handing O
control O
of O

over O
to O
the O
Requisitionists O
, O
whose O
interest O
and O
motives O
may O
be O
questionable O
, O
may O
not O
be O
in O

Group I-ORG
's E-ORG

interest O
. O
However O
, O
the O
Requisitionists O
are O
simply O
seeking O
an O
EGM O
to O
allow O
the O
democratic O
process O
of O
the O
company O
to O
take O
place O
. O
Whether O
that O
process O
will O
result O
in O
the O
Requisitionists O
taking O
control O
is O
unknown O
before O
the O
EGM O
has O
taken O
place O
. O
In O
this O
case O
, O
granting O
the O
injunction O
Tanoto S-PETITIONER

seeks O
would O
severely O
undermine O
the O
democratic O
process O
within O
USP B-ORG

Group I-ORG
. E-ORG

It O
would O
also O
entrench O
the O
current O
Board O
of O
Directors O
against O
any O
new O
board O
that O
the O
Requisitionists O
may O
bring O
forward O
. O
This O
is O
not O
acceptable O
. O
83 O
Third O
, O
Tanoto S-PETITIONER

says O
that O
USP B-ORG

Group E-ORG

is O
currently O
embroiled O
in O
four O
lawsuits O
. O
As O
such O
, O
he O
says O
that O
allowing O
the O
EGM O
to O
proceed O
at O
this O
time O
would O
distract O
the O
current O
Board O
from O
the O
proper O
management O
of O
the O
ongoing O
lawsuits O
. O
This O
is O
especially O
because O
Tanoto S-WITNESS

is O
a O
key O
witness O
in O
the O
lawsuits O
. O
In O
my O
view O
, O
this O
is O
not O
a O
good O
reason O
for O
a O
permanent O
injunction O
. O
It O
is O
clear O
that O
all O
lawsuits O
will O
end O
at O
some O
time O
, O
even O
if O
, O
at O
the O
time O
they O
are O
ongoing O
, O
they O
seem O
like O
an O
eternity O
to O
the O
parties O
concerned O
. O
If O
the O
lawsuits O
will O
end O
, O
then O
what O
basis O
is O
there O
for O
a O
permanent O
injunction O
against O
the O
Requisitionists O
from O
ever O
requisitioning O
for O
an O
EGM O
? O
In O
any O
event O
, O
whether O
Tanoto S-WITNESS

is O
a O
key O
witness O
in O
those O
lawsuits O
or O
not O
is O
irrelevant O
to O
the O
question O
of O
whether O
he O
should O
continue O
to O
remain O
as O
a O
director O
. O
This O
is O
because O
he O
is O
presumably O
being O
called O
as O
a O
witness O
in O
relation O
to O
his O
knowledge O
as O
a O
director O
at O
the O
material O
times O
, O
which O
would O
relate O
to O
matters O
in O
the O
past O
. O
This O
does O
not O
require O
him O
to O
stay O
on O
as O
a O
director O
of O

Fourth O
, O
Tanoto S-PETITIONER

says O
that O
the O
first O
resolution O
at O
the O
intended O
EGM O
to O
remove O
him O
from O
his O
role O
as O
CEO O
at O
USP B-ORG

Group E-ORG

is O
ultra O
vires O
because O
the O
company O
's O
constitution O
provides O
that O
this O
is O
a O
matter O
for O
the O
Board O
, O
and O
not O
the O
shareholders O
, O
to O
decide O
. O
Even O
if O
this O
resolution O
is O
ultra O
vires O
, O
why O
should O
that O
be O
extrapolated O
to O
prevent O
the O
Requisitionists O
from O
ever O
requisitioning O
another O
EGM O
where O
such O
a O
resolution O
may O
not O
be O
put O
forward O
? O
In O
my O
view O
, O
the O
fact O
that O
Tanoto S-PETITIONER

even O
makes O
such O
an O
argument O
shows O
that O
he O
is O
not O
acting O
in O
good O
faith O
. O
85 O
For O
all O
of O
these O
reasons O
, O
I O
do O
not O
think O
that O

has O
a O
reasonable O
belief O
that O

In O
sum O

the O

For O

until O
such O
time O
when O
the O

simply O
because O

I O
therefore O
