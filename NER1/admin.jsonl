Singapore is no exception. They generate not only human pain and anguish but legal issues as well. Cases, both civil and criminal, often come before the courts. This is inevitable, indeed, necessary. There is a weighty public element involved. This public element is clearly present when it is decided to prosecute offenders under, for example, the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed) or even the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed). It is also present in civil claims, although the primary area of law (principally with regard to tortious negligence) involves, on the face of things, individual claims and, hence, individual rights. This is due to the widespread nature of traffic accidents themselves. Other issues, besides liability between and amongst the parties, arise as a result. One such instance is the regulation of lawyers' fees, albeit, as we shall see, with a \"light touch\". This, as we shall also see, constitutes the crux of the present decision.\n2 In so far as the issue of the regulation of lawyers' fees is concerned, it is important to note at the outset that the law is almost invariably about balance. Whilst lawyers perform an important, even laudable, function and ought therefore to be remunerated adequately for their efforts, as already alluded to above, the sheer number of traffic accidents introduces a not insignificant measure of public policy into the entire equation.\n3 To this end, the Singapore Parliament enacted s 18 of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act (Cap 189, 2000 Rev Ed) (\"the MVA\"). This provision aids in ensuring that lawyers' remuneration in the context of traffic accident cases is fair not only to the lawyer but also (and more importantly) to the client.\nSection 18 of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act\n\n4 Because s 18 of the MVA is not only the focus of the present decision but must also be read as well as interpreted in its entire context, it is presently set out in full, as follows:\nProhibition of solicitation in respect of claims\n18.--(1) No person shall, directly or indirectly, solicit instructions or authority to act on behalf of any other person in respect of the making or commencement of any claim or action for damages for the death of or bodily injury to any person arising out of the use of a motor vehicle or in respect of the negotiation, compromise or settlement of that claim or action.\n(2) No person, other than a public officer or an advocate and solicitor properly acting in the course of his profession, shall, directly or indirectly, for personal gain make or commence or cause to be made or commenced on behalf of any other person any claim or action for damages for the death of or bodily injury to any person arising out of the use of a motor vehicle or negotiate, settle or compromise that claim or action when made or commenced.\n(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of any other written law, a public officer or an advocate and solicitor, acting in respect of the matters referred to in subsection (2), shall not receive or accept any payment of money for so acting other than --\n(a) such costs as are agreed between him and the Public Trustee;\n(b) taxed costs, in default of such agreement with the Public Trustee; or\n(c) such costs as the Public Trustee may determine to be the costs of the public officer or advocate and solicitor, if the public officer or advocate and solicitor fails to begin proceedings for taxation of costs within 3 months after the relevant date unless before that time the public officer or the advocate and solicitor has agreed with the Public Trustee on costs.\n(4) Subsection (3) shall not apply to a public officer or an advocate and solicitor claiming costs in respect of a judgment or settlement for a sum not exceeding the relevant amount.\n(5) For the purposes of subsection (3) (c), \"relevant date\" means --\n(a) the date the Public Trustee accepts or the court approves the payment referred to in section 6, as the case may be; or\n(b) the date the judgment of the court referred to in section 9 (1) is given,\nas the case may be.\n(6) Any person who contravenes this section shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $1,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both.\n(7) Any agreement to pay any money other than the costs referred to in subsection (3) (a), (b) or (c) to any person for work done or to be done or services rendered or to be rendered in respect of the matters referred to in subsection (1) or (2) shall be void.\n(8) Any money paid under subsection (7), shall be recoverable by action brought in a court by the person who has paid it.\n(9) Where it is shown that any money other than costs referred to in subsection (3) (a), (b) or (c) has been paid to any clerk employed by an advocate and solicitor for work done or to be done or services rendered or to be rendered in respect of the matters referred to in subsection (1) or (2), it shall be presumed in, and for the purposes of, any action against the advocate and solicitor that the money was received by the clerk on behalf of the advocate and solicitor and the money shall be recoverable from the advocate and solicitor.\n5 As we shall see, the Public Trustee's role also figures prominently in the issues that follow. In this respect, s 19 of the MVA is also relevant and reads as follows:\nPublic Trustee may appear in court\n19. The Public Trustee shall have the right to appear and be heard in a court in any proceedings under this Act or in relation to any claim or action for damages for the death or bodily injury of any person arising out of the use of a motor vehicle.\nThe issues stated\n\n6 The crucial issue in the present decision turns on a construction of s 18 in general and s 18(3) in particular of the MVA (the relevant provisions are reproduced at [4] above). What, in particular, is the effect of s 18 in relation to the presumption under O 59 r 28(2)(b) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2004 Rev Ed) (reproduced at [13] below)?\n7 However, before proceeding to analyse the key issues as well as points of law which are the focus of the present decision, it would be appropriate to set out briefly the specific context of this case.\n8 The present proceedings arose, in fact, in the context of a relatively typical case. Indeed, as an even cursory perusal of the main provision in this case itself (s 18(3)) will reveal, this particular subsection deals, inter alia, with the costs recoverable by an advocate and solicitor in so far as claims involving death or bodily injury arising out of the use of motor vehicles are concerned. As I have pointed out right at the outset, such claims are - unfortunately - very commonplace in the Singapore context.\n9 Indeed, this case involved precisely a claim arising out of a traffic accident involving a motor vehicle. The plaintiff was travelling as a pillion rider on a motorcycle ridden by the defendant and was injured as a result of a collision between the said motorcycle and a motor car. After the matter had been resolved (which involved interlocutory judgment against the defendant, followed by the assessment of damages), there remained the issue of costs. The plaintiff had in fact engaged her own counsel, who is the applicant in the present proceedings. Unfortunately, the applicant and the Public Trustee were unable to agree as to the costs between solicitor and client. If they had (under s 18(3)(a)), that would have been, in my view, the best or most ideal outcome. Costs were therefore sent before an assistant registrar for taxation pursuant to s 18(3)(b) (there being no issue of timing which would have triggered the operation of s 18(3)(c)). The learned assistant registrar fixed costs for Section 1 of the applicant's bill of costs in favour of the applicant at $15,000. The applicant was dissatisfied with the order and hence applied for its review. That was the precise issue before me in the present proceedings.\n10 Counsel for the Public Trustee in fact vigorously opposed any revision upwards of the costs fixed by the assistant registrar. On the contrary, he was of the view that they were in fact too high. He also tendered specific arguments as to why I should dismiss the application. I turn, however, to arguments by counsel for the applicant first. I will then set out the arguments by counsel for the Public Trustee before proceeding to analyse all these arguments as well as to express my decision.\n11 I only pause to add that although the factual matrix was exceedingly straightforward, the various arguments made were extremely significant - if only because claims under the MVA are (and this is one occasion when repetition is in fact in order) all too common and, hence, a pronouncement on the general legal position is appropriate.\nCounsel's arguments\nThe applicant's arguments\n\n12 This case related to a situation of costs as between solicitor and client. Not surprisingly, therefore, the applicant's main argument centred around O 59 of the Rules of Court in general (which deals directly with the situation of solicitor-client costs) and r 28(2)(b) thereof in particular.\n13 In addition to this particular provision, I now set out, further, O 59 r 28(1) as well as O 59 r 28(2)(a) and (c), in order to place the first-mentioned provision in its general context:\n28.--(1) This Rule applies to every taxation of a solicitors' bill of costs to his own client.\n(2) On a taxation to which this Rule applies, costs shall be taxed on the indemnity basis but shall be presumed --\n(a) to have been reasonably incurred if they were incurred with the express or implied approval of the client;\n(b) to have been reasonable in amount if their amount was, expressly or impliedly, approved by the client; and\n(c) to have been unreasonably incurred if, in the circumstances of the case, they are of an unusual nature unless the solicitor satisfies the Registrar that prior to their being incurred he informed his client that they might not be allowed on a taxation of costs inter partes.\n[emphasis added]\n14 The applicant's argument, in essence, was this: that in view of the agreement by the client to pay her solicitor (the applicant) $40,000 as costs, the amount awarded by the assistant registrar (of $15,000) for Section 1 of the applicant's bill of costs was too low and ought to be reviewed and, indeed, reversed. The agreement just referred to is to be found in the following paragraph of a letter written by the plaintiff to the applicant dated 4 August 2004:\nSince the Defendant is not prepared to file an appeal if I don't do so, I am not prepared to file an appeal. In this way, I am assured that my damages will not be reduced. However, since the costs given to you is too low and does not reflect the actual work done by you, I am prepared to agree to pay you a sum of $42,000.00 for your solicitor-and-client costs ($10,000.00 to be paid by the Defendant and $32,000 to be paid by me). [The defendant had submitted $30,000 for party and party costs but the assistant registrar fixed the award at $10,000.] The sum of $42,000 comprises of $40,000.00 for your professional fee and GST of $2,000.00. You will recover your disbursements from the Defendant.\nI authorise you to give a copy of this letter to the Public Trustee at the appropriate time.\nI confirm that I have made this decision after consulting my father and it is made in my own free will.\nI thank you for your work done in this matter.\n[emphasis added]\n15 The applicant's argument rested, in particular, on the presumption under O 59 r 28(2)(b) of the Rules of Court, which provision has been set out above (at [13]). Indeed, counsel went so far as to argue that the presumption was conclusive and that the said agreement should govern these proceedings and that costs of $40,000 should therefore be payable by the client to the firm, as agreed.\n16 I should add at this juncture that I detected no untoward motives in the applicant's argument. However, the fact that the applicant was under the clear impression that the argument centring on the presumption mentioned in the preceding paragraph was clearly correct makes it imperative that the argument itself should be analysed and ruled upon - if nothing else, because of the significant implications that arise from the sheer number of traffic accidents that occur, albeit unfortunately, each day.\n17 The main plank of the applicant's case centred, as just mentioned, around O 59 r 28(2)(b). It is true, however, that an application for review of taxation (such as the present proceedings) is a hearing de novo (see the Singapore Court of Appeal decision of Tan Boon Hai v Lee Ah Fong\n[2002] 1 SLR 10\n), although this does not mean \"the taxation process begin[s] afresh before the judge\" as \"[t]he power to decide afresh and conducting the proceedings afresh are not the same thing\" and that, hence, \"[t]here is no necessity to begin completely afresh\" (see per Choo Han Teck JC (as he then was) in the Singapore High Court decision of Lau Liat Meng & Co v Lum Kai Keng\n[2002] 4 SLR 400\nat [10])).\n18 Although the applicant did canvass a few specific arguments, I was not convinced that they merited an award of costs beyond that awarded by the assistant registrar after a half-day hearing. If there were to be an upward revision of the costs awarded to the applicant in the present case, it would have to be premised on the main plank mentioned at the outset of [15] above.\nThe Public Trustee's arguments\n\n19 Counsel for the Public Trustee argued, inter alia, that the whole case of the applicant centred around the fact that there had been an agreement between solicitor and client and that this would constitute, in effect, a \"backdoor\" around s 18(3) of the MVA. In his view, s 18 of the MVA necessarily overrides O 59 r 28 of the Rules of Court.\n20 He also argued that the case in question involved no complexity and that the bulk of damages awarded constituted loss of earning capacity (this was correct inasmuch as it comprised $480,000 out of the total sum awarded of $670,641.72). Further, no experts had been called by the defendant.\nThe court's findings\n\n21 Whilst the applicant's arguments were forcefully put, I was, unfortunately, unable to accept them.\n22 First, I was not persuaded that the presumption of reasonableness of the amount under O 59 r 28(2)(b) was a conclusive or irrebuttable one. The language of the provision itself is clear and there is a presumption of reasonableness, but it goes too far, in my view, to argue that such a presumption is conclusive or irrebuttable. The draconian effect of a conclusive or irrebuttable presumption is underscored by the language of s 4(3) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) itself, which reads as follows:\nWhen one fact is declared by this Act to be conclusive proof of another, the court shall, on proof of the one fact, regard the other as proved, and shall not allow evidence to be given for the purpose of disproving it.\n23 For that very reason, an irrebuttable or conclusive presumption ought not to be found by the court, save where it is clear from the language and\/or intent of the provision concerned (see, for example, s 43(2) of the Evidence Act as well as ss 82 and 83 of the Penal Code).\n24 Indeed, as Prof Jeffrey Pinsler, who furnished the illustrative statutory provisions referred to in the preceding paragraph, very aptly puts it in his learned volume, Evidence, Advocacy and the Litigation Process (LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2003), at p 252:\nAs conclusive presumptions are absolute it may be more appropriate to regard them as rules of substantive law.\n25 An even cursory reading of O 59 r 28(2)(b) will reveal that it militates against both reason as well as the general spirit behind the provision itself that a conclusive or irrebuttable presumption could have been intended - not least because the Rules of Court themselves deal, ex hypothesi, with rules of procedure and not substantive law as such.\n26 Further, the argument against an irrebuttable presumption in so far as O 59 r 28(2)(b) is concerned is buttressed by the provisions of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 2001 Rev Ed) (\"LPA\"), in particular, those provisions that relate directly to agreements between solicitor and client in so far as remuneration of the former by the latter is concerned (and see generally the leading work by Prof Tan Yock Lin in The Law of Advocates and Solicitors in Singapore and West Malaysia (Butterworths Asia, 2nd Ed, 1998) at ch 9).\n27 I have in mind, in particular, s 111 of the LPA, which relates to contentious business agreements between solicitor and client. The term \"contentious business\" is itself defined in s 2 of the LPA as meaning \"business done, whether as an advocate or a solicitor, in or for the purposes of proceedings begun before a court of justice or before an arbitrator\". There is no doubt that the present proceedings indeed related to \"contentious business\". Section 111 of the LPA itself reads as follows:\nAgreement as to costs for contentious business\n111.--(1) Subject to the provisions of any other written law, a solicitor or a law corporation may make an agreement in writing with any client respecting the amount and manner of payment for the whole or any part of its costs in respect of contentious business done or to be done by the solicitor or the law corporation, either by a gross sum or otherwise, and at either the same rate as or a greater or a lesser rate than that at which he or the law corporation would otherwise be entitled to be remunerated.\n(2) Every such agreement shall be signed by the client and shall be subject to the provisions and conditions contained in this Part.\n28 The effect of an agreement made pursuant to s 111 is set out in s 112 of the LPA, but need not concern us in the present proceedings. Section 113, however, is relevant, and reads as follows:\nEnforcement of agreements\n113.--(1) No action or suit shall be brought or instituted upon any such agreement as is referred to in section 111.\n(2) Every question respecting the validity or effect of the agreement may be examined and determined, and the agreement may be enforced or set aside without suit or action on the summons, motion or petition of any person or the representatives of any person, party to the agreement, or being or alleged to be liable to pay, or being or claiming to be entitled to be paid the costs, fees, charges or disbursements in respect of which the agreement is made, by the court in which the business or any part thereof was done or a Judge thereof, or, if the business was not done in any court, then by the High Court or a Judge thereof.\n(3) Upon any such summons, motion or petition, if it appears to the court or Judge that the agreement is in all respects fair and reasonable between the parties, it may be enforced by the court or Judge by rule or order, in such manner and subject to such conditions (if any) as to the costs of the summons, motion or petition as the court or Judge thinks fit.\n(4) If the terms of the agreement are deemed by the court or Judge to be unfair or unreasonable, the agreement may be declared void.\n(5) The court or Judge may thereupon order the agreement to be given up to be cancelled, and may direct the costs, fees, charges and disbursements incurred or chargeable in respect of the matters included therein to be taxed, in the same manner and according to the same rules as if the agreement had not been made.\n(6) The court or Judge may also make such order as to the costs of and relating to the summons, motion or petition and the proceedings thereon as the court or Judge thinks fit.\n(7) When the amount agreed for under any such agreement has been paid by or on behalf of the client or by any person chargeable with or entitled to pay it, any court or Judge having jurisdiction to examine and enforce the agreement may, on application by the person who has paid the amount within 12 months after payment, if it appears to the court or Judge that the special circumstances of the case require the agreement to be reopened, reopen it, and order the costs, fees, charges and disbursements to be taxed, and the whole or any portion of the amount received by the solicitor or law corporation to be repaid by him, on such terms and conditions as to the court or Judge seems just.\n(8) Where any such agreement is made by the client in the capacity of guardian or of trustee under a deed or will, or of committee of any person or persons whose estate or property will be chargeable with the amount payable under the agreement or with any part of that amount, the agreement shall before payment be laid before the Registrar, who shall examine it and disallow any part thereof, or may require the direction of the court or a Judge to be taken thereon by summons, motion or petition.\n(9) If in any such case the client pays the whole or any part of the amount payable under the agreement without the previous allowance of the Registrar or court or Judge as aforesaid, he shall be liable at any time to account to the person whose estate or property is charged with the amount paid, or with any part thereof, for the amount so charged.\n(10) The solicitor or law corporation who accepts the payment may be ordered by any court which would have had jurisdiction to enforce the agreement, if it thinks fit, to refund the amount received by him or the law corporation.\n29 What is germane for present purposes is the fact, in the words of a leading author, that all contentious business agreements entered into between solicitor and client \"will have to survive the scrutiny of the court and it reflects the particular jealousy with which the court regards work done in court\" (see Tan, [26] supra, at p 691).\n30 It is also illuminating that the Practice Directions and Rulings (1989) issued by the Law Society of Singapore has this to say in the context of non-refundable deposits or retainers paid by clients to their solicitors in the context of contentious work (see ch 1, r 37(a)):\nThe Council emphasises [that s 111] of [the] Legal Profession Act does not give solicitors a carte blanche to agree to an unreasonable fee and that it is well settled that over-charging a client whether in a bill of costs or otherwise may amount to professional misconduct.\n31 In other words, no agreement for the payment of costs between client and solicitor is sacrosanct in the sense that it is conclusive and immune to, as well as impervious from, any investigation by the court itself. That such agreements can in fact be - and are - subject to the court's scrutiny, particularly from the perspective of reasonableness and fairness, is established in both local as well as English case law (see, for example, the Singapore High Court decisions of Shamsudin bin Embun v PT Seah & Co\n[1986] SLR 510\nand Re Nirumalan Kanapathi\n[2000] 1 SLR 726\n, especially at [25]).\n32 Returning to O 59 r 28(2)(b) of the Rules of Court, where there is clear evidence that the amount was jarringly out of all proportion to that which would be awarded under any normal circumstances for similar work done by a solicitor for his or her client, then I should think that that would be a situation where the presumption under that provision would in fact be rebutted. It is true that such a situation might indicate that there was something amiss with the actual agreement between the client and his or her solicitor. However, it does not seem to me to be practical to place the onus on the client to challenge the agreement when that agreement is in fact before the court in the first place. Logic and common sense would suggest that the court ought to take the plain fact of the immense disparity into account when assessing what costs ought to be paid by the client to his or her solicitor - rather than allow the client to raise this point in perhaps a separate action. Indeed, one ought to bear in mind the fact that most clients are - apart from the wise counsel provided by their own solicitors - wholly ignorant of the law (interestingly, I note the following (and only) statement which apparently issued from the plaintiff's lips during the taxation proceedings before the learned assistant registrar, which was this: \"We have already agreed on the amount of $38,000 (voluntarily). I do not know the law.\"). In the nature of things, the solicitor concerned could hardly be expected to advise the client as to whether or not the costs that very solicitor seeks is too high, no matter how well-meaning that solicitor might subjectively be. This is why, as I have mentioned, the court has little choice but to decide the issue accordingly. And this applies equally to taxation or, as in the present proceedings, a review of taxation.\n33 Indeed, the present factual matrix is precisely one such situation where the presumption under O 59 r 28(2)(b) cannot be conclusive for yet another - and even clearer - reason. This is where there is an overriding statutory provision. Indeed, this is precisely the situation in the present case. This statutory provision concerned is s 18 of the MVA, which has been reproduced above (at [4]).\n34 The legislative history and context of the provision just mentioned is both instructive and, in my view, conclusive with regard to the proposition made in the preceding paragraph.\n35 On a more general level, the MVA was first enacted as the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Ordinance in 1960 (as Ordinance No 1 of 1960). During the Second Reading of the Bill, the then Minister for Labour and Law, Mr K M Byrne, made the following observations (see Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (13 January 1960) vol 12 at col 18):\nThe aim of the Bill is to put an end to the practice which is resorted to by some lawyers of engaging touts to solicit and obtain accident claims cases and arranging to keep a substantial portion of the compensation received for themselves. In this way the unfortunate victims of road accidents have been cheated of the sums rightly due to them by these unscrupulous lawyers, and I am glad to say that the majority of the members of the Bar and the insurance companies have welcomed the move of the Government to put a stop to this racket.\n36 More specifically, in its original form, s 18(3) of the MVA actually made it mandatory that all costs payable to, inter alia, a solicitor would be subject to taxation. This provision apparently found its initial incarnation when the Act itself was first enacted in 1960. The provision (as the then s 17(3)) read, at that particular point in time, as follows:\nNotwithstanding the provisions of any other written law any costs payable to a public officer or an advocate and solicitor acting in respect of the matters referred to in subsection (2) of this section shall be taxed and such public officer or advocate and solicitor shall not receive or accept any payment of money for so acting other than such taxed costs.\n37 Commenting generally on s 18 in its original form during the Second Reading of the Bill, Mr Byrne observed thus ([35] supra, at col 17):\nClause 16 of the Bill makes it an offence for a person to solicit instructions or authority to act on behalf of any other person in respect of the making or commencement of any claim or action for damages for death or personal injury arising out of the use of a motor vehicle, or in respect of the negotiation, compromise or settlement of such claim or action. It is also made an offence for any person, other than a public officer or an advocate and solicitor, to make or cause to be made any claim on behalf of any other person for such damages. A public officer or advocate and solicitor who acts for another person in respect of such claim will only be entitled to payment of his taxed costs, and if any other sum is paid for work done or services rendered in respect of any claim or action for such damages, such sum may be recovered by the person who paid it. [emphasis added]\n38 Section 18(3) was amended by the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) (Amendment) Act 1994 (No 26 of 1994), where, by virtue of s 4 of this particular amendment Act, an exception to taxation of costs was made with respect to a judgment or settlement for a sum not exceeding $5,000. To this end, the amended provision read as follows:\nNotwithstanding the provisions of any other written law, any costs payable to a public officer or an advocate and solicitor acting in respect of the matters referred to in subsection (2), except in respect of a judgment or settlement for a sum not exceeding $5,000, shall be taxed and the public officer or advocate and solicitor shall not receive or accept any payment of money for so acting other than the taxed costs. [emphasis added]\n39 Even then, the interests of motor accident victims were paramount. In moving the Second Reading of the amendment Bill, the then Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law, Assoc Prof Ho Peng Kee, observed thus, in so far as the rationale underlying this particular amendment was concerned (see Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (5 December 1994) vol 63 at col 942):\n[T]hese amendments, when passed, will also benefit motor accident victims whose claims are less than $5,000, as these claims no longer attract any court, stamp and solicitors' fees incurred in taxation of the solicitors' bills. The Public Trustee's fees in handling the case need no longer be paid. These are all savings in costs for the motor accident victim. In addition, with the absence of the Public Trustee's and the court's involvement in these cases, these accident victims will receive their compensation moneys earlier. This is something which I am sure the victims will appreciate.\n40 The Act was further amended by s 9 of the Statutes (Miscellaneous Amendments and Repeal) Act 2000 (No 28 of 2000). During the Second Reading of the Bill, the then Minister of State for Law, Assoc Prof Ho Peng Kee, observed thus (see Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (9 October 2000) vol 72 at cols 833-834):\nThe Act protects the interest of claimants by requiring lawyers acting on behalf of claimants to submit their charges to the courts for scrutiny. This is to ensure that the lawyers' charges are fair and reasonable. The Bill makes two adjustments to this system. First, the Bill makes it unnecessary for a lawyer to submit his charges for scrutiny by the courts if the Public Trustee agrees with the charges. This will result in savings in time and resources for the courts and the lawyers involved. Second, the Bill allows the Public Trustee to decide what charges the lawyer should claim if the lawyer fails to submit his charges for court scrutiny within three months after the compensation amount has been approved by the Public Trustee or fixed by a court. Delay by a lawyer in submitting his charges for court scrutiny means delay in the payment of compensation to his client. This is unfair to the client.\nThe Bill also empowers the Public Trustee to appear and argue in any court case involving a claim of compensation for personal injury arising from traffic accident. This will give the Public Trustee greater flexibility in fulfilling his role of protecting the interests of persons claiming such compensation.\n[emphasis added]\n41 The amendments effected by the amendment Act just mentioned are important as they resulted not only in the present form taken by s 18 (reproduced above at [4]) but also resulted in the introduction of s 19 (then numbered as s 18A, and reproduced above at [5]). These amendments were effected, respectively, by ss 9(4) and 9(5) of the Statutes (Miscellaneous Amendments and Repeal) Act 2000.\n42 The legislative intention is clear. It is to ensure that claimants or plaintiffs are protected and that they pay their respective solicitors only such charges as are fair and reasonable. As we have already seen above (at [36]), it used to be the situation that all charges so payable were subject to taxation and that, to alleviate the situation, an exception was made in respect of a judgment or settlement for a sum not exceeding $5,000 (see above at [38]). The amendments effected by this latest Act were, as the extracts from the parliamentary debates just quoted above (at [40]) clearly confirm, intended to streamline the situation further by excluding the necessity for taxation if the Public Trustee agreed with the charges by the solicitor. This is in fact the very pith and marrow of s 18(3)(a) itself. It follows, therefore, that s 18(3) is not intended to sanction agreements for costs between solicitor and client without more. Indeed, the underlying legislative intention of this particular provision is, as we have just seen, quite different. Indeed, s 18(3) read with s 19 actually provides the legislative machinery for the Public Trustee with the necessary locus standi to argue against an agreement between solicitor and client if this proves necessary. Counsel for the Public Trustee in the present case stated that this was in fact a rare occurrence but that it was felt necessary for the Public Trustee to be involved in the present proceedings for the reasons briefly set out above.\n43 It should, however, be noted that s 18(4) of the MVA continues to sanction costs claimed with regard to a judgment or settlement for a certain sum - or, to be more precise, \"in respect of a judgment or settlement for a sum not exceeding the relevant amount\" [emphasis added]. In this regard, s 18(3) is expressly stated to be inapplicable. And s 2 of the MVA defines \"relevant amount\" as meaning \"$5,000 or, where an amount has been prescribed by the Minister under section 20 for the purposes of sections 6 (1), 9 (2) and (8) and 18 (4), the prescribed amount\" [emphasis added]. It is equally clear, however, that the present situation does not fall within the purview of s 18(4) as the plaintiff recovered an amount far in excess of $5,000.\n44 In the circumstances, it is clear that the weighty elements of public interest and policy contained within (especially) s 18(3) of the MVA clearly prevail over any agreement for costs entered into between solicitor and client. If so, the argument by the applicant to the effect that the presumption under O 59 r 28(2)(b) is an irrebuttable one cannot be maintained. The presumption just mentioned would, at most, have been a rebuttable one. It therefore follows that the argument by the applicant to the effect that the presumption is irrebuttable must fail.\n45 Indeed, the overriding public interest element embodied within s 18(3) of the MVA is underscored by the words commencing \"[n]otwithstanding the provisions of any other written law\". It is also underscored by the other related subsections within s 18 itself. For instance, s 18(7) provides that \"[a]ny agreement to pay money other than the costs referred to in subsection (3) (a), (b) or (c) to any person for work done or to be done or services rendered or to be rendered in respect of the matters referred to in subsection (1) or (2) shall be void\" [emphasis added]. Indeed, s 18(8) provides that \"[a]ny money paid under subsection (7), shall be recoverable by action brought in a court by the person who has paid it\". And s 18(6) provides for penal sanctions for contravention of the provisions of s 18 itself.\n46 I am fortified in my decision by a decision of then Senior Assistant Registrar (and now Justice) Tay Yong Kwang in Phua Lay Chay v Chai Kuan Way\n[1988] SGHC 97.\nAn appeal against the learned Senior Assistant Registrar's taxation review was subsequently dismissed by Wee Chong Jin CJ. In that case, Snr Asst Registrar Tay dealt with a fact situation not unlike the present. The plaintiff had sued the defendant for injuries suffered during a road accident where the defendant's motor car had collided with the plaintiff's motorcycle. The action was subsequently settled and the bill was presented for taxation as between solicitor and client. It will be recalled that, at this particular point in time, taxation was compulsory (see generally [36] above).\n47 The charges for work done and time expended were drawn for $32,000, while the party and party costs were agreed at $18,000. The Public Trustee agreed to a deduction of $9,000, leaving the costs at $23,000. However, Snr Asst Registrar Tay was of the view that $23,000 was excessive and reduced the amount by another $4,000, allowing the bill at $19,000 (not including disbursements). Of particular significance to the present case are the learned Senior Assistant Registrar's observations, as follows (at [18]):\nThe fact that the client (the plaintiff) agreed also to paying the solicitor $23,000 can be dismissed from my mind. He is advised by the solicitor whose bill it is. He has hardly any idea of the amount of costs that he ought to pay. When he appeared before me at the taxation, he indicated to me that he would leave everything in my hands as he was a layman. The legislative intent evident in s 18(3) and (5) of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act would be defeated if I were to allow solicitor and client costs in personal injury cases to be agreed through this back-door means. [emphasis added]\nConclusion\n\n48 Precedent, legislative history as well as reason and public policy compel me to arrive at three clear propositions, as follows.\n49 Firstly, the presumption set out in O 59 r 28(2)(b) of the Rules of Court is merely a rebuttable one.\n50 Secondly, even assuming that the presumption set out in O 59 r 28(2)(b) is otherwise conclusive, s 18 of the MVA is nevertheless an overriding provision and cannot be subject to, or constrained by, any prior agreement as to costs between client and solicitor.\n51 Thirdly, the court has an overriding jurisdiction to examine every agreement for legal costs notwithstanding any prior written agreement. In cases where a solicitor enters into an agreement for costs with a client unschooled in the ways of commerce, the court will take particular care in scrutinising such agreements for fairness and appropriateness. This would be a fortiori the case where, as in the present proceedings, there are overriding public policy considerations involved as well.\n52 In the circumstances, I dismissed the application with costs.\nApplication dismissed.\nCopyright (c) Government of Singapore.\n","label":[[2,17,"PETITIONER"],[19,31,"RESPONDENT"],[62,89,"CASE_NUMBER"],[106,119,"DATE"],[137,147,"COURT"],[156,182,"JUDGE"],[201,220,"LAWYER"],[225,240,"LAWYER"],[242,272,"ORG"],[293,305,"LAWYER"],[307,345,"ORG"],[380,395,"PETITIONER"],[399,410,"RESPONDENT"],[472,487,"PROVISION"],[488,502,"STATUTE"],[524,531,"PROVISION"],[532,587,"STATUTE"],[634,646,"PROVISION"],[647,659,"STATUTE"],[683,690,"PROVISION"],[691,746,"STATUTE"],[771,786,"PROVISION"],[787,829,"STATUTE"],[1029,1046,"PROVISION"],[1047,1090,"STATUTE"],[1091,1104,"DATE"],[1105,1131,"JUDGE"],[1219,1228,"GPE"],[1568,1607,"STATUTE"],[1620,1653,"STATUTE"],[2642,2662,"ORG"],[2671,2675,"PROVISION"],[2683,2773,"STATUTE"],[2953,2963,"PROVISION"],[2971,3026,"STATUTE"],[3038,3042,"PROVISION"],[3050,3053,"STATUTE"],[4241,4255,"PROVISION"],[4848,4862,"PROVISION"],[5185,5194,"PROVISION"],[5273,5286,"PROVISION"],[5593,5623,"PROVISION"],[5746,5767,"PROVISION"],[5808,5822,"PROVISION"],[5974,6004,"PROVISION"],[6178,6199,"PROVISION"],[6560,6564,"PROVISION"],[6572,6575,"STATUTE"],[6990,6994,"PROVISION"],[7010,7017,"PROVISION"],[7039,7042,"STATUTE"],[7136,7140,"PROVISION"],[7178,7193,"PROVISION"],[7201,7243,"STATUTE"],[7640,7647,"PROVISION"],[7974,7983,"GPE"],[8687,8697,"PROVISION"],[8847,8857,"PROVISION"],[8934,8944,"PROVISION"],[8995,9004,"PROVISION"],[9896,9899,"STATUTE"],[10255,10259,"PROVISION"],[10267,10281,"STATUTE"],[10365,10375,"PROVISION"],[10468,10480,"PROVISION"],[10492,10515,"PROVISION"],[11529,11538,"PROVISION"],[12816,12831,"PROVISION"],[12839,12853,"STATUTE"],[13715,13730,"PROVISION"],[13860,13885,"COURT"],[13898,13940,"PRECEDENT"],[14202,14218,"JUDGE"],[14243,14263,"COURT"],[14276,14334,"PRECEDENT"],[14987,14994,"PROVISION"],[15002,15005,"STATUTE"],[15020,15024,"PROVISION"],[15032,15035,"STATUTE"],[15058,15067,"PROVISION"],[15075,15089,"STATUTE"],[15597,15612,"PROVISION"],[15939,15945,"PROVISION"],[15953,15987,"STATUTE"],[16443,16450,"PROVISION"],[16458,16470,"STATUTE"],[16482,16494,"PROVISION"],[16502,16512,"STATUTE"],[16910,16925,"PROVISION"],[17306,17321,"PROVISION"],[17374,17424,"STATUTE"],[17689,17698,"GPE"],[17703,17716,"GPE"],[17795,17800,"PROVISION"],[17808,17811,"STATUTE"],[17945,17948,"PROVISION"],[17956,17959,"STATUTE"],[18211,18222,"PROVISION"],[18230,18233,"STATUTE"],[18997,19002,"PROVISION"],[19017,19022,"PROVISION"],[19030,19033,"STATUTE"],[19087,19098,"PROVISION"],[19274,19285,"PROVISION"],[19886,19896,"COURT"],[23050,23088,"STATUTE"],[23103,23127,"ORG"],[23320,23325,"PROVISION"],[23336,23356,"STATUTE"],[24009,24029,"COURT"],[24043,24092,"PRECEDENT"],[24097,24136,"PRECEDENT"],[24176,24191,"PROVISION"],[26110,26125,"PROVISION"],[26349,26353,"PROVISION"],[26361,26364,"STATUTE"],[26623,26626,"STATUTE"],[26652,26749,"STATUTE"],[26828,26840,"OTHER_PERSON"],[27464,27474,"ORG"],[27549,27556,"PROVISION"],[27564,27567,"STATUTE"],[27806,27813,"PROVISION"],[28038,28052,"PROVISION"],[28253,28257,"PROVISION"],[28318,28326,"OTHER_PERSON"],[28366,28375,"PROVISION"],[29252,29265,"PROVISION"],[29285,29373,"STATUTE"],[29395,29398,"PROVISION"],[29773,29787,"PROVISION"],[30219,30241,"OTHER_PERSON"],[31055,31058,"PROVISION"],[31066,31136,"STATUTE"],[31214,31237,"OTHER_PERSON"],[32718,32722,"PROVISION"],[32790,32794,"PROVISION"],[32813,32818,"PROVISION"],[32899,32915,"PROVISION"],[32923,32978,"STATUTE"],[33777,33787,"PROVISION"],[33824,33831,"PROVISION"],[34049,34071,"PROVISION"],[34526,34533,"PROVISION"],[34541,34544,"STATUTE"],[34784,34791,"PROVISION"],[34836,34839,"PROVISION"],[34847,34850,"STATUTE"],[34958,34968,"PROVISION"],[34989,35029,"PROVISION"],[35165,35172,"PROVISION"],[35358,35365,"PROVISION"],[35373,35376,"STATUTE"],[35543,35558,"PROVISION"],[35863,35870,"PROVISION"],[35878,35881,"STATUTE"],[36045,36049,"PROVISION"],[36072,36079,"PROVISION"],[36160,36190,"PROVISION"],[36313,36334,"PROVISION"],[36376,36383,"PROVISION"],[36422,36436,"PROVISION"],[36524,36531,"PROVISION"],[36600,36604,"PROVISION"],[36713,36727,"OTHER_PERSON"],[36731,36775,"PRECEDENT"],[36881,36898,"JUDGE"],[36914,36936,"OTHER_PERSON"],[37588,37610,"OTHER_PERSON"],[38277,38292,"PROVISION"],[38300,38355,"STATUTE"],[38687,38702,"PROVISION"],[38710,38724,"STATUTE"],[38812,38827,"PROVISION"],[38853,38857,"PROVISION"],[38865,38868,"STATUTE"],[39613,39636,"ORG"]],"Comments":[]}

Respondent\nJUDGMENT\n\n[Criminal Procedure and Sentencing] -- [Appeal]\n[Criminal Law] -- [Statutory offences] -- [Work Injury Compensation Act (Cap 354, 2009 Rev Ed)]\nMia Mukles\nv\nPublic Prosecutor\n[2017] SGHC 252\n\nHigh Court -- Magistrate's Appeal No 9110 of 2017\nSteven Chong JA\n31 August 2017\n13 October 2017 Judgment reserved.\nSteven Chong JA:\nIntroduction\n\n1 The Appellant, Mia Mukles, is a Bangladeshi who worked for Wee Seng Marine and Engineering Pte Ltd (\"Wee Seng\"). At the material time, he was working on a modular section of a hull under construction (\"the Block\") at Keppel Fels Shipyard (\"the Shipyard\"). He is appealing against his conviction on two charges in the court below. The first charge was for making a fraudulent claim for compensation under the Work Injury Compensation Act (Cap 354, 2009 Rev Ed) (\"WICA\"), an offence under s 35(2)(f) and punishable under s 35(2)(iv) of the WICA. The second charge was for making a false statement to an investigation officer (\"IO\") during the investigation in respect of his compensation claim, which is an offence under s 35(2)(c) of the WICA.\n2 It is not disputed that the Appellant submitted a claim for compensation under the WICA. It is also not disputed that he made a statement to the IO that he sustained injury to his back when he fell while climbing up a ladder in the course of his work on the Block. The only dispute in the court below and on appeal is whether the claim and consequently the statement were false. The District Judge (\"the Judge\") found against the Appellant on both scores. The convictions therefore turn entirely on one factual issue - is there any reasonable doubt that the Appellant fell from the ladder thereby injuring his back while working on the Block on 17 May 2015?\n3 The Judge convicted the Appellant of both charges and sentenced him to two terms of imprisonment of six weeks and four weeks for the first and second charges respectively and ordered both sentences to run concurrently. The Judge preferred the evidence of the prosecution witnesses and found the Appellant's evidence to be \"inconsistent, incoherent or incredible\" (see the Grounds of Decision (\"the GD\") at [71]). In particular, the Judge accepted the eye witness account of a fellow Bangladeshi worker who saw the Appellant walk up to the ladder area and sit down before lying down on the floor (see the GD at [41]-[45]). This is diametrically contrary to the Appellant's claim that he fell off a ladder while working on the Block.\n4 For this appeal, counsel for the Appellant, Mr Anil Narain Balchandani, raises many arguments to challenge the Judge's findings. I find two of the arguments particularly troubling not just because they were not raised during the trial below but also because they allege serious impropriety against the prosecution witnesses, their two employers, and the Shipyard without having put these allegations to them and without any evidential foundation.\n5 First, in his zeal to advance the Appellant's best case, Mr Balchandani alleges that the prosecution witnesses had colluded with each other to provide false testimony to wrongly implicate the Appellant, an innocent man. His submission went so far as to suggest that the collusion involved the Shipyard, Wee Seng, and another sub-contractor, OUS Pte Ltd (\"OUS\"). Not only was this collusion theory not formally put to the witnesses during the trial, there is simply no evidential basis for such serious allegations to be made in the first place. The second argument which troubles me concerns some videos and photographs (Exhibits D3 to D8 - collectively, \"the Exhibits\") which the IO received from the Shipyard and which were brought to the attention of the Judge just before the close of the Prosecution's case. Their existence emerged in the course of the IO's cross-examination. The Prosecution explained that it was not relying on the Exhibits as it took the position that the Exhibits were at best neutral to the two charges. The Judge nevertheless gave the Appellant sufficient time to consider the Exhibits and thereafter allowed him to recall several witnesses following an interval of some four months. Despite Mr Balchandani's submission that the Exhibits, in particular the videos, were exculpatory of the Appellant, the Judge found that the Exhibits did not assist the Appellant but instead undermined the Appellant's defence (see the GD at [83]). What is especially disturbing is that for this appeal, without any factual or expert evidence, Mr Balchandani maintains the same submission he made before the court below that it is \"plausible\" that the videos had been tampered with or at least edited by the Shipyard. The very nature of such an allegation cries out for substantiation. Yet this was not even put to any witness in the court below. Mr Balchandani claims on appeal, as he did below, that he only realised the possibility of the videos having been edited while he was preparing his closing submissions for the trial. His belated personal assessment of the videos offers no excuse for his misconceived pursuit of such a serious allegation without any independent factual foundation.\n6 While it is the duty of every counsel to put forward all available arguments in the best interest of his client, it is equally important for counsel to recognise his overarching duty as an officer of the court (see Public Trustee and another v By Products Traders Pte Ltd and others [2005] 3 SLR(R) 449 at [26] and [35]). The balancing of these twin duties requires counsel to make submissions in a responsible manner. This is especially so if the submission suggests either impropriety (such as evidence-tampering) or the commission of a crime (which in this case would be perjury alleged against the prosecution witnesses with the connivance of the Shipyard, Wee Seng, and OUS). In my view, submissions of such gravity should never be made by counsel without any legitimate evidential basis and without putting the serious charges to the relevant witnesses to afford them an opportunity to respond. To do otherwise would not only be reckless but would also be a breach of counsel's ethical duties.\n7 I think it is timely to remind counsel of two important provisions in the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015 (S 706\/2015) (\"the PCR\"), namely rr 12(3) and 12(4) which bear on such conduct:\n12.-- ...\n(3) A legal practitioner must not, by asserting in a statement to a court or tribunal, make any allegation against a witness whom the legal practitioner cross-examined or was given an opportunity to cross-examine, unless the legal practitioner has given the witness an opportunity to answer the allegation during cross-examination.\n(4) A legal practitioner must not suggest that a witness or any other person is guilty of any offence or conduct, or attribute to a witness or any other person any offence or conduct of which the legal practitioner's client is accused, unless the suggestion or attribution relates to a matter in issue (including the credibility of the witness) which is material to the client's case and which appears to the legal practitioner to be supported by reasonable grounds.\n[emphasis added]\nBy failing to put serious allegations to the witnesses, counsel run the risk of breaching these two provisions.\nNo reason to disturb the Judge's assessment of the witnesses\n\n8 It is common ground between the parties that an appellate court has a limited scope of review over a trial judge's findings of fact (Public Prosecutor v Wang Ziyi Able [2008] 2 SLR(R) 61 at [91]) and an \"extremely heavy burden\" is cast on an appellant to displace such findings of fact (Syed Jafaralsadeg bin Abdul Kadir Alhadad v Public Prosecutor [1998] 3 SLR(R) 352 at [57]). When a trial judge makes finding of fact based on the credibility of witnesses whom he has had the opportunity to see and assess, an appellate court will generally defer to the conclusion which the trial judge has formed unless the appellate court is \"convinced\" that the trial judge's decision was wrong (Public Prosecutor v Poh Oh Sim [1990] 2 SLR(R) 408 at [8]). The decision of the Judge was largely based on his assessment of the witnesses whom he heard over a nine-day trial. His findings (which were painstakingly set out in a 51-page GD) must be examined against the conspicuous absence of any bruising or swelling to the Appellant's back. Given the Appellant's description of the severity of the pain he endured, one would have expected there to be bruising or swelling or some form of physical appearance of the injury.\n9 Having considered the parties' submissions and the evidence, I find that there is plainly no reason for me to disturb the Judge's assessment of the witnesses. I begin by examining the evidence of the prosecution witnesses, specifically that of Md Safikul Islam (Safik) Md Sukkur Ali (\"Safikul\"), Ali Hasmot (\"Hasmot\"), Ashek Abdul Hashem (\"Ashek\"), and Sujon Moniruzzaman (\"Sujon\").\nEye witness account - Safikul\n\n10 The most crucial witness was Safikul. He witnessed the Appellant feigning the fall. Safikul testified that he saw the Appellant bend down and move towards the ladder. After that, the Appellant sat down, laid down on the floor next to the ladder and then shouted that he had fallen from the ladder. It follows from Safikul's evidence that the Appellant did not fall while climbing up the ladder. Safikul testified that he was observing the Appellant because he was concerned that the Appellant might enter the area where lifting operations were taking place under his supervision.\n11 I note that Safikul was in close proximity to the Appellant throughout the entire incident. He was only approximately three to four and a half metres away from the Appellant. He had a clear line of vision to the Appellant as the Appellant walked to the location of the ladder with his body bent, and subsequently sat and laid down on the floor. Referring to Exhibit D8, Mr Balchandani argues that Safikul's line of sight was obstructed by objects and materials standing between Safikul's position and the Appellant's position at the time of the incident. In my view, Exhibit D8 does not assist the Appellant. On the contrary, it confirms Safikul's evidence that the Appellant had to bend down before he could lie down on the ground next to the ladder, which was under the Block. Exhibit D8 also shows that Safikul's line of vision was not completely blocked. The mere fact that there were other objects in his line of vision did not prevent Safikul from observing the Appellant's behaviour. There is no reason for me to doubt the Judge's assessment that Safikul was well able to observe the Appellant's movement towards the ladder and thereafter his lying down next to it.\n12 Next, in an attempt to challenge Safikul's eye witness account, the Appellant relies on Sujon's testimony that he did not notice any lifting operations or any person standing at Safikul's position at the time of the alleged incident. However, the mere fact that Sujon did not notice the lifting operations does not mean that the lifting operations did not take place. Sujon explained that the reason he did not notice the lifting operations was because he was \"underneath ... the [B]lock doing [his] work\" whereas lifting works are normally done outside the [B]lock. Ashek's testimony that he did not know of any person by the name of Safikul also cannot possibly assist the Appellant. That Ashek does not know Safikul is irrelevant to the inquiry as to whether Safikul's evidence is to be believed. After all, they worked for different companies - Safikul worked for OUS while Ashek worked for Wee Seng. I should add that the fact that Ashek did not know Safikul reinforces my finding that Safikul had no reason to collude with Ashek and the other prosecution witnesses to falsely implicate the Appellant (this is elaborated at [20]-[22] below). Further, Safikul's evidence was consistent throughout the trial. Even after he was recalled and the videos were disclosed, his evidence remained unshaken. He confirmed that his view of the ladder was not obstructed and that he saw the Appellant walk towards the ladder, before sitting and lying down on the floor. The Appellant also sought to discredit Safikul's testimony by comparing his evidence with that of Hasmot's. Safikul said that he saw the Appellant moving his body from side to side on the floor while Hasmot stated that the Appellant rolled his body twice over. However, Safikul did testify when he was recalled that the Appellant \"sat and he lied down, then he start to roll\". Such a minor inconsistent description of some bodily movement does not affect Safikul's clear evidence that he saw the Appellant sitting down before lying down on the floor instead of falling off the ladder while climbing.\n13 I will now turn to the evidence of the other prosecution witnesses, namely Hasmot, Ashek, and Sujon.\nHasmot, Ashek, and Sujon\n\n14 The Appellant is correct in stating that neither Hasmot, Ashek, nor Sujon witnessed what Safikul saw (ie, the Appellant walking towards the ladder, bending down, and lying on the floor). Nonetheless, their evidence is relevant to the pivotal question of whether the Appellant had any reason to climb up the ladder to the second level of the Block. This, together with their observations of the Appellant's behaviour and reaction after the alleged fall, supports the Judge's finding that the Appellant did not fall while climbing up the ladder at the material time.\nWas the Appellant instructed to do any work on the second level?\n\n15 While the questions of whether the Appellant had any reason to climb up the ladder and whether he did in fact climb up the ladder are strictly separate inquiries, it is, nonetheless, crucial to understand the context under which the fall allegedly occurred, as recounted by the Appellant. It is the Appellant's own evidence that he was instructed by Hasmot to go up to the second level to \"cut the support\". However, in the Appellant's online submission for his workplace injury claim he stated that he was instructed by Ashek instead to do the grinding work on the support ... standing upon the staging ladder almost 2 [metres] [high]\". Although the Appellant gave conflicting accounts as to who had instructed him to go to the second level, it is clear that his case is that he did not use the ladder to climb up on his own accord. On either account, his evidence was that he was instructed to do so. Therefore, on the Appellant's own case, the two inquiries are inextricably connected. If he was not instructed by Hasmot or Ashek to do any work on the second level as he claimed, it stands to reason that the Appellant, by his own evidence, had no reason to use the ladder and consequently did not fall while climbing up the ladder.\n16 Ashek, who is the Appellant's supervisor, testified that the Appellant had no reason to use the ladder at the material time. This was not challenged. According to Hasmot, the Appellant had complained that he was suffering from a stomach ache and a headache. It was Hasmot's evidence that he told the Appellant to \"take [a] rest\" and that he did not need to work. He added that there was no urgency to finish the work as they were not on a tight schedule. There is also no dispute that Hasmot did contact Ashek, his supervisor, to get a replacement for the Appellant after the latter claimed that he was not feeling well. It was during this call that the Appellant allegedly climbed the ladder to undertake some work on the second floor and thereafter allegedly fell from the ladder. However, it was never put to Hasmot that he had specifically instructed the Appellant to go to the second level to do some work, whether it was cutting or grinding or even both. Instead, all that was put to Hasmot was that he had told the Appellant to continue working and \"so he went and climbed to level 2\". The distinction between the two is quite material because it was the Appellant's own evidence that Hasmot had specifically instructed him to go to the second level to \"cut the support\". Further, during the hearing of the appeal, Mr Balchandani submitted that Hasmot had lied in that he only contacted Ashek and requested for a replacement after the Appellant had fallen from the ladder. However, when probed, he conceded that this was never put to Hasmot in cross-examination. Leaving aside for the moment the Appellant's conflicting evidence as to the nature of work he was tasked to do on the second level, I agree with the Prosecution and, in particular, the Judge's finding that there was no reason for the Appellant, \"in his 'stricken' condition\", to do any work on the second level of the Block at the time of the incident (see the GD at [32]). Not only was the Appellant allegedly unwell, Hasmot had specifically told him that he had \"no need to work\" as Hasmot was already calling for a replacement for him. The Appellant did not dispute the fact that Hasmot had made these statements to him and I see no reason to disbelieve Hasmot's evidence.\n17 Another important point to note is the fact that the Appellant was barely a metre from Hasmot at the time of the incident. It would be too much of a coincidence that the Appellant would use the ladder to climb to the second level to do work which he was not instructed to do at the precise moment when Hasmot had his back turned away from the Appellant while calling Ashek for the replacement worker. It is therefore difficult to imagine how Hasmot would not have noticed the Appellant climbing and falling from the ladder if that had actually happened.\n18 The prosecution witnesses' observations of the Appellant's behaviour and reaction after the alleged fall also support the Judge's finding that the Appellant did not fall while climbing up the ladder. According to Hasmot, when the Appellant was on the floor, he complained to Hasmot that he had \"more stomach and headache\". Ashek also consistently testified that when he saw the Appellant, he was rubbing \"both hands on his stomach\". In fact, on seeing the Appellant in this condition, he thought that he was suffering from stomach pain. What is particularly telling is that Ashek did not see the Appellant holding onto his back at any time. Likewise, Sujon testified that when he arrived at the scene of the alleged accident, he saw the Appellant rubbing his stomach. All these unchallenged observations are entirely inconsistent with the Appellant's claim that he injured his back as a result of his alleged fall.\n19 It is futile for the Appellant to identify inconsistencies in the evidence of the prosecution witnesses where they have no bearing to the relevant issues before the court. The Appellant identifies inconsistencies such as (a) when lunch break was held; (b) whom they had lunch with; (c) who was the first to attend to the Appellant, (d) whether Ashek had poured water on the Appellant's head; and (e) who had helped the Appellant to the Shipyard clinic. In my view, these trivial discrepancies are not material to the relevant inquiry as to whether the Appellant had any reason to use the ladder and whether he fell from the ladder in the process. Given Hasmot's evidence that he had told the Appellant to rest, coupled with the Appellant's failure to put to Hasmot that he had specifically instructed the Appellant to go to the second level to do work, it is simply not open to the Appellant to challenge the Judge's finding that he did not fall while climbing up the ladder. He had no reason to go up to the second level to begin with.\nCollusion - a baseless submission\n\n20 It is unacceptable for the Appellant to rely on these irrelevant inconsistencies to make the astonishing submission that such inconsistencies arose because the prosecution witnesses were \"told generally to state that the Appellant feigned the accident but the details as to how he feigned the accident were lost in translation\". In essence, the Appellant's case is that Hasmot, Ashek, Sujon and Safikul had colluded to provide false testimonies to incriminate an innocent man but somehow the collusion was carried out incompetently. The Appellant expressly submits:\n... that the witnesses had colluded or rehearsed some part of their testimon[ies] to promote a larger objective. The larger objective is to accuse the Appellant of fabricating the incident so that the Shipyard would not have to answer to the Ministry of Manpower. [emphasis added]\n21 I agree with the Prosecution that there is no evidence for this incredible claim. In my view, there is no conceivable motive for any of the prosecution witnesses to have colluded against the Appellant. Quite apart from the undeniable fact that it was never put to any of them that they had colluded with one another to concoct false evidence against the Appellant, it bears mention that all of them, save for Safikul, were identified by the Appellant as his witnesses whom the Ministry of Manpower (\"MOM\") could inquire with in order to verify his compensation claim. The significance of the Appellant's choice lies in the fact that the Appellant obviously regarded them as witnesses who would speak the truth should they be approached by MOM to assist in processing his claim. This makes the failure to put the collusion allegation to them all the more egregious. While it was suggested to Hasmot and Safikul that they had lied in relation to certain aspects of their evidence (for example, that the Appellant was suffering from a headache and stomach ache, that the Appellant rolled one metre away, and in respect of Safikul's position at the time of the incident ), it is entirely different to suggest that they had colluded with each other to falsely incriminate the Appellant. Inherent in any collusion is an agreement among witnesses to provide false evidence in a co-ordinated manner. What is even more unacceptable is Mr Balchandani's submission that \"it cannot be a very distant thought to form a nexus between [Wee Seng] and [the Shipyard], and OUS and [the Shipyard] to arrive at a conclusion that [the Shipyard] likely orchestrated a story to benefit [Wee Seng]\" [emphasis added]. This is a shocking submission in blatant breach of the rule in Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67 and possibly rr 12(3) and (4) of the PCR.\n22 There is also no reason for Safikul to have falsified his evidence against the Appellant. Safikul worked for OUS, a different company from that of the Appellant. There is no evidence that Safikul had anything to gain from testifying against the Appellant or bore any ill will towards him. It is improper for Mr Balchandani to submit that Safikul \"was beholden to [OUS] and was told to state certain facts in a manner that represented the overall story that [the Shipyard] wished to portray to the IO: that an accident did not happen and that the Appellant feigned the entire incident\". It is improper because Mr Balchandani effectively accused Safikul of perjury at the instigation of the Shipyard when it was never even put to Safikul. It is also unacceptable for Mr Balchandani to launch a scurrilous attack to unfairly impugn the reputation of three companies, namely the Shipyard, Wee Seng, and OUS.\nThe Appellant's evidence\n\n23 Unlike the inconsequential discrepancies in relation to the prosecution witnesses' evidence, the discrepancies in the Appellant's evidence were significant as they directly concerned the circumstances of the alleged fall. The discrepancies in the Appellant's evidence relate to (a) his reasons for climbing the ladder; (b) whether he was wearing a helmet at the time of the incident; (c) whether he was unconscious immediately following his fall; and (d) whether he was carried from the in-house hospital to the lorry.\n24 The Judge found that the Appellant gave inconsistent explanations as to why he had to use the ladder to get up to the second level of the Block. For the appeal, Mr Balchandani devotes much effort to explain that the Appellant's evidence in this regard was not in fact inconsistent. According to Mr Balchandani, there was apparently some confusion in the Appellant's evidence as to whether cutting and grinding were separate tasks when in truth they meant the same thing. He submits that the Judge failed to take into account the Appellant's clarifications in re-examination.\n25 The Appellant initially testified that he had to do \"pipe support work\". Later, he testified that he went up to the second level to \"cut a support\". This differed from his online form to MOM and earlier statement to MOM where he claimed that he was to do grinding work. He then tried to equate cutting with grinding despite explaining that grinding was for the purpose of smoothening the surface. The Appellant argues that cutting requires using a different edge of the disc of the grinding machine but this does not change the fact that his testimony was inconsistent in respect of the type of work he was engaged in. However, in his re-examination, the Appellant, in response to Mr Balchandani's question as to whether cutting and grinding in the industry mean the same thing, answered in the affirmative.\n26 In my view, it is a wholly misdirected exercise to seek to reconcile the different explanations provided by the Appellant as to the work he was tasked to do on the second level before he allegedly fell. Even if I am prepared to give the Appellant the benefit of the doubt that he might have provided inconsistent answers about the task he was asked to do on the second level because he did not fully understand the questions asked of him in cross-examination, it is important not to lose sight of the real significance of this line of questioning. Its significance lies in establishing whether the Appellant had any reason to use the ladder in the first place. It should not be overlooked that the Appellant was assisting Hasmot with his work that day. It is the Appellant's own evidence that he was instructed by Hasmot to go up to the second level to \"cut the support\". However, it was never put to Hasmot that he had specifically instructed the Appellant to do any work on the second level of the Block. This was a significant omission considering Hasmot's evidence that he had told the Appellant to rest as he was calling for a replacement worker. In other words, Hasmot, whom the Appellant was assisting, did not task the Appellant to do any work on the second level.\n27 Second, the Appellant gave vacillating accounts as to whether he was wearing a helmet when he hit the ground. Initially, he could not remember if the helmet was on his head because he claimed to have lost his \"memory\" and consciousness when he hit the ground. Subsequently, when the Appellant was asked to provide an explanation as to why he did not suffer from a head injury, he then changed his explanation that this was because he was wearing his helmet when he hit the ground. When questioned further as to whether his helmet was on his head when he hit the ground, he said that after he fell down, he \"cannot say anything\". I accept that there might be some doubt as to whether the Appellant was wearing a helmet when he was observed to be walking to the ladder area. In this respect, I note that Safikul testified that he saw the Appellant wearing a helmet as he walked towards the ladder (not when he was found lying on the ground) while the objective evidence suggests otherwise. In Exhibit D3, one of the persons in the Appellant's vicinity when he was on the ground can be heard repeatedly asking the Appellant, \"where is your helmet?\" Further, Exhibits D4 and D7 show the Appellant's position on the ground after the fall but no helmet could be seen in the vicinity. However, the materiality of the Appellant's conflicting accounts lies in the reason for his vacillations and not the factual inquiry per se as to whether he was in fact wearing a helmet. It appears to me that he changed his evidence in order to reconcile the fact that he did not sustain any head injury notwithstanding that his head allegedly hit the ground causing him to lose consciousness momentarily.\n28 Third, although the Appellant claims that he was unconscious immediately following his fall, this is not supported by any objective evidence. It is not disputed that no one saw the Appellant in an unconscious state. What I find interesting is the Appellant's claim that someone must have removed his helmet when he was on the floor in order to pour water on his head. He said he saw Hasmot pouring water on his head while he was lying on the ground and that Sujon also told him that he did the same. This was confirmed by Hasmot and Sujon. In fact, Sujon testified under cross-examination that he poured the water at the Appellant's request because he claimed to be suffering from a headache and not because they found him in an unconscious state. Both Hasmot's and Sujon's evidence was unchallenged. That water was poured at the request of the Appellant because he had complained of a headache is neither consistent with the Appellant's alleged back injury nor a reaction from an unconscious person.\n29 Fourth, even though Mr Balchandani (presumably on the Appellant's instructions) had put it to Ashek that he and a few others carried the Appellant from the hospital or from the clinic to the lorry, this was refuted by the Appellant himself who said that his friends had merely helped him to walk and that he climbed onto the lorry on his own. The video in Exhibit D6 likewise shows the Appellant walking unassisted towards the lorry and climbing up the lorry with its tailgate still up.\n30 In the circumstances, there is no reason to disturb the Judge's finding that the Appellant's evidence was indeed \"inconsistent, incoherent or incredible\" (see the GD at [71]). In any event, his evidence did not undermine the Prosecution's evidence.\nThe medical evidence\n\n31 I turn now to the medical evidence before the court. In examining the medical evidence, it is important to bear in mind the Appellant's claims that he lost consciousness after the fall and that the pain due to his back injury was at the maximum level of 10 even after he was administered two pain killer injections. Therefore, if the Appellant's evidence is to be believed, the fall and the consequent injury must have been quite severe. However, does the medical evidence bear out the severe back injury claimed by the Appellant?\n32 The convictions against the Appellant are premised on the falsity of his claim that he fell while climbing up a ladder to do some work on the second level and thereby sustained injury to his back. Hence, the question is whether the medical evidence before the court has raised any reasonable doubt that the Appellant falsely claimed that he fell from the ladder and suffered a back injury as a result, and not whether the Appellant suffered any back strain or contusion per se. Pertinently, even if it is accepted that the Appellant was suffering from some back injury, the court must ask whether the evidence has established that the back injury was actually caused by the fall. In this regard, the medical evidence must necessarily be assessed with reference to the Appellant's evidence of the nature of his fall and the extent of his injury. It is also critical to examine the medical evidence with reference to the evidence of the prosecution witnesses, namely Safikul, Hasmot, Ashek, and Sujon, whose evidence is in itself sufficient to convict the Appellant of the two charges.\n33 The evidence of Dr Benjamin Ding and Dr Thomas Catabas on the whole does not raise any reasonable doubt. Dr Ding examined the Appellant on the day of the alleged fall while Dr Catabas reviewed the Appellant a week later on 25 May 2015.\n34 Dr Ding's diagnosis that the Appellant suffered from lower back contusion was premised on the Appellant's oral history, his physical examination of the Appellant, as well as a CT scan. He explained that his physical examination involved an observation of the Appellant's posture and by palpation, ie, feeling the location of the pain indicated by the Appellant. He observed that the Appellant was \"not in too severe pain\" and was able to walk. According to Dr Ding, the CT scan showed evidence of \"mild disc disease\". When he was asked what \"mild disc disease\" meant, Dr Ding opined that the best person to comment would be the radiologist on duty that day. Nonetheless, he testified that the CT scan disclosed no fracture or dislocation.\n35 Dr Catabas' diagnosis was that of a \"back strain\". At trial, he explained that his diagnosis was based on the account or history provided by the Appellant, his physical examination of the Appellant, as well as an X-ray investigation. He noted that the X-ray results were unremarkable, meaning that there were no significant findings and no fracture detected. Although Dr Catabas' \"main source\" of information leading to his diagnosis was the Appellant's own account, he explained that the Appellant's account must go \"hand in hand\" or correlate with the physical examination. From his physical examination, he noted there was \"no bruising, no swelling, no tenderness, no steps felt\". When asked how such physical examination results could be consistent with the diagnosis of a back strain, Dr Catabas explained that the diagnosis was \"from what the patient complained of\" and that \"back strain is one of the ... diagnos[es] that [he] usually use[d] for patients who come in with the complaints of back pain although the physical examination itself is unremarkable\".\n36 I agree with the Prosecution that there is no objective evidence to support the Appellant's case that he suffered from any back injury as a result of falling from the ladder. The Appellant claims that he lost consciousness after the fall and experienced pain at the maximum level of 10. However, the evidence shows that there was no bruising or swelling and that the X-rays and CT scans were unremarkable and did not reveal any fresh injury. In my view, such severe pain is entirely inconsistent with the complete lack of objective evidence such as bruising, swelling, or tenderness. Mr Balchandani relies on the two pain killer injections given to the Appellant at the Shipyard's clinic before he boarded the lorry in his effort to explain why the Appellant was able to board the lorry without assistance. However, as the Judge noted at [55] of the GD, the Appellant claimed that the pain was still at the maximum level of \"10\" even after the injections.\n37 Further, having reviewed the video evidence, I find that the videos are entirely inconsistent with the fall as described by the Appellant. For instance, immediately after the alleged fall, he was found on the floor rubbing his stomach. He did not indicate to Hasmot, the first person who attended to him, that his back was injured. Also, the Appellant was able to walk and climb onto the lorry without assistance. Mr Balchandani submits that the Appellant climbed up the lorry unassisted because he was ordered to do so. That submission misses the point. If the injury was so severe (based on the Appellant's claim that he lost consciousness and experienced the maximum pain level of \"10\" even after the two injections), in all likelihood, it would not have been possible for the Appellant to climb onto the lorry without assistance even if he had been told to do so.\n38 While the doctors opined under cross-examination (upon being recalled as witnesses) that it was \"possible\" or that it would \"appear to be\" the case that the Appellant's back injury was consistent with him having fallen from the ladder, it is important to refrain from quoting their evidence out of context. Quite often, a witness' answer depends on how the question is framed. Hence, it is always essential to analyse the evidence on the whole and in its proper context. When Dr Ding was asked why he thought the Appellant's back injury was most likely consistent with the alleged fall, he explained \"[b]ecause I mean from the history it says that he fell from the ladder and landed on his back and there is a ladder and then he's shown on his back in the video\" [emphasis added]. From my assessment of their evidence as a whole, it is clear that their diagnoses of possible back injury were based on the Appellant's account of the alleged incident together with the Appellant's indication of the location of the pain. What is noteworthy is that none of the doctors testified that they would have arrived at their diagnoses or concluded that the Appellant's back injury was due to a fall from a ladder without the Appellant's oral history. Dr Catabas testified that looking at the videos alone, without the history from the patient, he would not be able to make his diagnosis. He stated clearly that he would \"still need the history from the patient\". Likewise, Dr Ding testified that without the history, it would \"not [be] possible to determine the cause\" and it would be \"hard to be certain of a fixed diagnosis\". Further, although both doctors testified that there were many possible causes for the back injury, neither of them was able to state affirmatively that the back injury (assuming that it did exist) was linked to the Appellant's fall from the ladder. In my view, contrary to the Appellant's written submissions, the medical evidence does not raise any reasonable doubt that the Appellant falsely claimed that the back injury was caused by the alleged fall.\nExhibits D3 to D8 and the Kadar disclosure principles\n\n39 The Appellant also takes issue with the time at which the Prosecution disclosed the Exhibits. The Appellant argues that the Prosecution had breached its duties of disclosure as set out in Muhammad bin Kadar and another v Public Prosecutor [2011] 3 SLR 1205 (\"Kadar\") and that the late disclosure meant that his counsel could not appreciate during the trial that the videos had been edited or tampered with in order to present a \"sanitized version of the events\" that was disadvantageous to the Appellant.\n40 The circumstances under which the Exhibits were introduced in court are relevant. While the IO was being cross-examined on his investigation process on 12 October 2016, he stated that he was informed in a call with the Shipyard that the Shipyard denied that the accident was work-related. The IO requested for an explanation from the Shipyard to support its position. In response, the Shipyard sent an email and transmitted the Exhibits online. The Prosecution explained that the videos were not disclosed earlier because they were regarded as neutral evidence concerning \"the aftermath of the incident\". Nonetheless, the Prosecution stated that it was intending to offer the Exhibits to the Appellant at the close of the Prosecution's case. The Judge directed the Prosecution to provide them to the Appellant immediately and not at the end of the Prosecution's case. The Judge also gave the Appellant the option of either continuing with the cross-examination of the IO or reviewing the Exhibits first. Mr Balchandani elected to carry on with his cross-examination on aspects that did not involve the Exhibits. The matter was then stood down to give Mr Balchandani more time to review the Exhibits. When the hearing resumed, Mr Balchandani applied to admit the Exhibits as Defence exhibits. The Prosecution did not object to their admission even though the maker(s) of the Exhibits remained unknown.\nKadar disclosure principles\n\n41 In the court below, the Appellant submitted that the Prosecution had contravened the principles in Kadar. In response, the Prosecution maintained that the Exhibits did not have to be disclosed at the start of the trial because they were neutral evidence. In its closing submissions, the Prosecution went further, submitting that the Exhibits were actually detrimental to the Defence.\n42 In Kadar, the statements by the deceased's husband, Mr Loh, had to be disclosed by the Prosecution because they were credible and relevant to the guilt or innocence of the accused persons (see Kadar at [202]). At trial, two brothers were convicted of murder on the basis that both were present in the deceased's flat although the trial judge was unable to conclude which of them actually murdered the deceased (see Kadar at [35(f)]). Mr Loh's evidence was there was only one person other than himself and the deceased in the deceased's flat throughout the incident. His statements consistently stated that there was only one intruder present in the flat (see Kadar at [5]). His evidence could therefore exculpate at least one of the two brothers.\n43 In the present case, however, the Exhibits cannot by any stretch be exculpatory of the Appellant. I agree with the Judge and the Prosecution that they certainly do not strengthen the Appellant's case, and in fact undermine his defence (see the GD at [83]). The Appellant submits the videos are exculpatory because they show him limping and show that assistance was not forthcoming even though he was in need of support. He claims that the Exhibits show that he had to climb up the lorry unassisted because he was forced to help himself. The Appellant also submits that the photographs were exculpatory because they evidence several things: (a) his proximity to the ladder during the incident; (b) his inability to roll either side as he was confined between the ladder and certain objects on the left; (c) that Safikul's line of sight had been obstructed; and (d) that there was a pool of water near his head, consistent with his testimony that he had had his helmet removed so that water could be poured on his head. However, in my view, the videos are not exculpatory. To begin with, they do not record the alleged fall. Instead, what they show is that the Appellant could walk to and climb onto a lorry unassisted. In the final analysis, I agree with the Prosecution that the Exhibits are at best neutral, and at worst, corroborative of the Prosecution's case that the Appellant was feigning his injury. Such evidence does not need to be disclosed pursuant to Kadar.\nTampering\/Editing of videos - another baseless submission\n\n44 In closing submissions before the court below, Mr Balchandani alleged that the Appellant was prejudiced by the Prosecution's late disclosure of the Exhibits because he was prevented from discovering in time that the videos could have been edited. Mr Balchandani claimed in written closing submissions that it was only at the stage of preparing his closing submissions that he was able to appreciate that the videos could have been \"edited to ... minimise the extent that the [Appellant] suffered trauma to his back\" [emphasis in original]. On appeal, Mr Balchandani maintains that he could not have substantiated the allegation of tampering because he did not have the opportunity to analyse the Exhibits due to the late disclosure. Without attempting any substantiation, he submits on appeal that \"the videos were edited to an extent to show a sanitized version of events\" [emphasis added]. Before dealing with this submission, it should be borne in mind that it was the Appellant who opted to admit the Exhibits as the Appellant's exhibits in the court below. Hence, they were marked D3 to D8. The tampering allegation was however never raised at the trial. Instead, it was only brought up for the first time in the Appellant's closing submissions after it became clear that the Prosecution was relying on the Exhibits in its closing submissions to undermine the Appellant's evidence.\n45 I find it extremely disturbing for Mr Balchandani to claim that the possibility of the videos having been edited only became apparent to him during the drafting of his closing submissions. Even if that were the case, he made no further attempt or application to the Judge to recall any witness or to offer new witnesses to make good his submission. Mr Balchandani also claims that the Appellant's application to recall Hasmot and Ashek was denied by the Judge. This is strictly incorrect. While Mr Balchandani did initially apply under s 230(1)(q) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) to recall Hasmot, Ashek, Safikul, Sujon and \"at the very least\" Dr Ding prior to the close of the Prosecution's case, the Judge informed him that the proper time to make the application was after the defence was called. Nevertheless, the Judge allowed the Appellant's application to recall the witnesses but directed Mr Balchandani to formally apply at \"the appropriate time\". Eventually, after the Appellant had completed his testimony, Mr Balchandani made a specific application to recall only the two doctors and Safikul. The Judge allowed the application despite the Prosecution's objections. Thus, it would appear that it was Mr Balchandani who decided not to recall Hasmot, Ashek, or any other witness; it is therefore disingenuous and unfair to criticise the Judge for failing to recall them on his own motion.\n46 The suggestion that the late disclosure was done to ambush the Appellant is also a non-starter. The witnesses were recalled on 2 February 2017, after a period of almost four months following the disclosure of the Exhibits on 12 October 2016. It is clear that the Appellant had more than enough time to consider the steps that he wished to take, including recalling more witnesses or applying to admit expert evidence to demonstrate that the videos had been tampered with. In fact, counsel for the Appellant indicated on 13 October 2016 that he needed time to find expert witnesses to deal with the contents of the Exhibits. However, he eventually did not offer any expert witness.\n47 In the circumstances, it is reckless for Mr Balchandani to suggest that the videos had been tampered with when there is simply no evidential basis whatsoever to support such a speculative suggestion. Although this is a very serious allegation, it was never put to any witness. Further, although the Appellant was given the option of recalling witnesses, he chose not to recall the IO. This is significant because the IO was the witness who received the videos from the Shipyard and was therefore the person who could possibly explain the provenance of the videos. If Mr Balchandani wanted to pursue the tampering allegation, he should have at least recalled the IO to initiate the train of inquiry. Having elected not to do so, any suggestion of the videos having been tampered with is plainly baseless.\n48 The Kadar duty of disclosure is not some poison pill. Not all breaches of this duty would cause a conviction to be overturned (see Kadar at [120]). There must be material irregularity that occasions a failure of justice (ie, the conviction must be rendered unsafe as a result of the late disclosure or non-disclosure). The court also stated at [121] that where disclosure is made after the commencement of the trial, the court may grant an adjournment of sufficient duration to allow defence counsel time to consider the effect of the disclosed material and to incorporate it into their case if necessary. Here, this was clearly done. As explained, the Judge ensured that the Appellant had sufficient time to examine the Exhibits and to make the necessary application(s) to recall witnesses or to take whatever further steps necessary (almost four months later) to address them.\nConclusion\n\n49 For these reasons, I find that the Judge was correct in finding that the two charges have been made out.

In February 2009, it was appointed by Jurong Data Centre Development Pte Ltd (\"JDD\") to design and build a high-tech data centre (\"the Data Centre\"). The first defendant, Leow Tet Sin, and the second defendant, Yukiyasu Nakagawa, were at all material times the only directors of JDD and the joint signatories of its bank accounts.\n2 In October 2009, JDD, having failed to make certain payments due to the plaintiff under the construction agreement signed between them on 19 February 2009 (\"the Construction Contract\"), executed a debenture in favour of the plaintiff. The security was given in order to induce the plaintiff to continue work on the Data Centre. By the terms of the debenture, JDD agreed that all \"Monetary Claims\" would be charged to the plaintiff by way of a first fixed charge.\n3 In January 2010, the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (\"IRAS\") refunded a sum of $6,456,230.09 (\"the GST Refund\") to JDD. Subsequently, JDD spent amounts totalling $5,348,413.51 out of the GST Refund. The plaintiff's position is that the GST Refund was a Monetary Claim and therefore subject to the charge in its favour. Accordingly, JDD should not have spent any part of the same. In this action, the plaintiff seeks to recover the said sum of $5,348,413.51 from the defendants, jointly and severally, on the basis that:\n(a) they dishonestly assisted in a breach of trust; or\n(b) they induced a breach of contract; or\n(c) they were engaged in fraudulent trading in respect of JDD within the terms of s 340 of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (\"the Act\").\nBackground\n\n4 At the material time, the JL Group of companies comprised Japan Land Ltd (\"Japan Land\"), a listed company incorporated in Singapore, Japan Asia Land Ltd (\"Japan Asia\"), a company incorporated in Japan and JDD. Japan Asia is a subsidiary of Japan Land but operates as the headquarters of the JL Group. In 2008, JDD was incorporated in Singapore as a special purpose vehicle to develop the Data Centre. JDD was wholly reliant on Japan Land and Japan Asia for funding as it had no other business apart from the development (and subsequent operation) of the Data Centre. During most of the material period, the president of Japan Land, and head of the JL Group, was one Mitsutoshi Ono (\"Mr Ono\").\n5 The first defendant is a certified public accountant who obtained his accountancy degree in 1970. In 2005, he was employed as the deputy managing director of Japan Land. He was promoted to the post of executive director in 2007 and when JDD was incorporated, the first defendant was made one of its directors. He continued to be the executive director of Japan Land and did not receive any extra remuneration for his position in JDD.\n6 The second defendant is a construction engineer by training and experience. In 2007, after working in construction engineering companies for about 40 years, he joined Japan Land as a director. The second defendant was appointed a director of JDD because of his construction engineering experience and he held this appointment in JDD concurrently with his position as director of Japan Land. Like the first defendant, he did not receive extra remuneration for the new post.\nThe Construction Contract and the search for investors\n\n7 In April 2008, JDD invited tenderers to quote for the construction of the Data Centre. The plaintiff was the successful tenderer. Under the Construction Contract, JDD agreed to pay the plaintiff $213,458,436.03 to design and complete the Data Centre on a turnkey basis. The Construction Contract provided for the plaintiff to be paid by way of progress payments. In mid-August 2009, JDD began to default on prompt payment of the progress payments and by October 2009, it owed the plaintiff about $60m.\n8 Meanwhile, Japan Land had been looking for a new investor to help with the financing of the Data Centre. In June 2009, it was approached by one Ang Chee Seng (\"Mr Ang\") the chief executive officer of a Singapore company, Elchemi Group Ltd (\"Elchemi\"), which was interested in investing in the Data Centre through its subsidiary ConnectedPlanet Holdings Ltd (\"CPH\"). A Memorandum of Understanding was signed between Elchemi, Japan Land and Japan Asia on 21 August 2009 and in order to facilitate the negotiations between the JL Group and Elchemi, work on the Data Centre had to continue uninterrupted. During the relevant period, the plaintiff was aware that there were negotiations taking place between JDD and Elchemi\/CPH for the latter to make a substantial investment in JDD.\n9 On 24 October 2009, a meeting was held in Tokyo to discuss the indebtedness owing to the plaintiff. This meeting was attended by the second defendant and Mr Ono on behalf of the JL Group. The plaintiff was represented by its chief executive officer, one Helmut Kurzboeck (\"Mr Kurzboeck\"). During the meeting, Mr Kurzboeck stated that work would not continue on the Data Centre unless payment or security was obtained from JDD. Since JDD could not pay, it agreed to provide a charge over its assets to the plaintiff - this was to prevent the plaintiff from proceeding with legal action against JDD under the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act (Cap 30B, 2006 Rev Ed) (\"SOPA\") to recover the outstanding amounts.\n10 Pierre Crisantha Dedigama (\"Mr Dedigama\"), the plaintiff's then managing director, contacted the first defendant on 27 October 2009 regarding the signing of a debenture and a security undertaking document. According to the first defendant, Mr Dedigama pressed for both documents to be executed by 9am on 28 October 2009. He threatened JDD, saying that if the documents were not signed by the deadline, the plaintiff would take legal action against JDD for the sums owed to the plaintiff. At the same time, according to the first defendant, he assured JDD that the documents were just to satisfy the plaintiff's head office in Vienna and enable the plaintiff to get continued funding to work on the Data Centre. They were not to take effect while negotiations were being carried out with Elchemi. JDD's lawyers, Rodyk & Davidson LLP (\"Rodyk\"), were given just one day to review the documents.\n11 After this assurance was allegedly given, a Japan Land board meeting was held on 28 October 2009 to approve the giving of security to the plaintiff by JDD. Mr Ang also gave his approval, via a written confirmation, that Elchemi was aware of the Debenture and Security Undertaking and that the two documents would not impede ongoing negotiations between JLL and Elchemi.\nThe Debenture\n\n12 Pursuant to the resolutions passed on 28 October 2009, JDD executed a debenture dated 28 October 2009 (\"the Debenture\") in favour of the plaintiff and an agreement entitled \"Security Undertaking\" also dated 28 October 2009 (\"the Security Undertaking\"). These documents were registered with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (\"ACRA\") on 25 November 2009.\n13 By the Debenture, JDD acknowledged the debt owed to the plaintiff and agreed to secure the same by granting to the plaintiff, among other things, a fixed charge over all Monetary Claims. The following provisions of the Debenture are relevant (JDD being the Chargor and the plaintiff being the Chargee):\n1.1 Definitions\n...\n\"Claims Account\" means an Account to be identified by the Chargee (and any renewal or re-designation of such account) maintained by the Chargor with any bank in Singapore into which, inter alia, the proceeds of the getting in or realisation of the Monetary Claims and the dividends, interest and other monies arising from the Shares are to be paid.\n...\n\"Monetary Claims\" means any book and other debts, monetary claims, credit sales, receivables and other receivables owing to the Chargor and any proceeds thereof (including any claims or sums of money deriving from or in relation to any Intellectual Property, any Investment, the proceeds of any Insurance Policy, any court order, award or judgment, any contract or agreement to which the Chargor is a party and any other assets, property, rights or undertaking of the Chargor).\n3.1 Fixed charges: The Chargor as beneficial owner hereby charges in favour of the Chargee, as security for the payment and discharge of the Secured Obligations, by way of first fixed charge (which so far as it relates to land in Singapore vested in the Chargor at the date hereof shall, if reasonably required by the Chargee, be perfected by the execution of a legal mortgage in the prescribed form) all the Chargor's right, title and interest from time to time in and to each of the following assets:\n...\n(h) all Monetary Claims other than any claims which are otherwise subject to a fixed charge or assignment (at law or in equity) pursuant to this Debenture and all Related Rights; ...\n10.1 Dealing with Monetary Claims : The Chargor shall not at any time during the subsistence of the Debenture, without the prior written consent of the Chargee:\n(a)deal with the Monetary Claims except by getting in and realising them in a prudent manner (on behalf of the Chargee) and paying the proceeds of those Monetary Claims promptly into the Claims Account or as the Chargee may require (and such proceeds shall be held upon trust by the Chargor for the Chargee prior to such payment in); or\n(b)factor or discount any of the Monetary Claims or enter into any agreement for such factoring or discounting; or\n(c)be entitled to withdraw or otherwise transfer the proceeds of the realisation of any Monetary Claims standing to the credit of any Claims Account.\n[bold underline in original; emphasis added in italics and bold italics]\n14 Under cl 10.1 of the Debenture, JDD was obliged to pay all Monetary Claims into the Claims Account and hold the proceeds on trust for the plaintiff. The Claims Account was never identified by the plaintiff. Under the Security Undertaking, JDD agreed make a payment of at least $24m to the plaintiff by 2 November 2009 to show its goodwill in continuing with the project. It further undertook to procure the written consent of Jurong Town Corporation (\"JTC\") for a mortgage of the land on which the Data Centre was being erected being Lot 8441A of Mukim 5 (\"the Property\") in favour of the plaintiff. In return, the plaintiff agreed under the Security Undertaking not to stop performing its obligations under the Construction Contract.\n15 The defendants' position is that at the time the security documents in favour of the plaintiff were executed, the plaintiff had agreed, as a collateral agreement, that it would not enforce the Debenture until the Data Centre had been completed and an investment agreement between the JL Group and Elchemi had been concluded. The defendants contend that the documents were provided to reassure the plaintiff's head office so that the plaintiff could continue to obtain funding from the head office and work on the Data Centre could continue. It was intended that they were not to take effect according to their terms and conditions and were not to be registered. The plaintiff disputes this and alleges that there was no such agreement in place. The dispute over the existence of the collateral agreement is reflected in correspondence between JDD and the plaintiff from 6 November 2009 to 10 November 2009.\nThe Investment Agreement\n\n16 On 3 November 2009, Japan Land and CPH entered into an agreement (\"the Investment Agreement\") pursuant to which Japan Land agreed to sell shares in JDD to CPH and CPH was to invest $71m in JDD. The deadline for the fulfilment of the parties' obligations under the Investment Agreement was 31 January 2010.\nThe SOPA proceedings\n\n17 JDD did not make payment as promised (see [14] above) on 2 November 2009. The next day, the plaintiff commenced proceedings under SOPA against JDD. On 10 December 2009, an adjudication order was made ordering JDD to pay the plaintiff $29,086,796.35 together with interest and costs as specified. The plaintiff did not extract this order immediately as it did not want to jeopardise the efforts being made to obtain the investment from CPH.\nThe Refinancing Agreement\n\n18 On 18 November 2009, JDD, the plaintiff and Elchemi met with JTC officers to explain what was happening with the Data Centre and to obtain JTC's consent for a grant of a mortgage over the Property to the plaintiff pursuant to cl 4.2(a) of the Security Undertaking. The first defendant explained that pending the investment by CPH, the mortgage would provide security to the plaintiff so that the plaintiff could complete the Data Centre. On 25 November 2009, the plaintiff, JDD and CPH entered into a Refinancing Agreement. Under the Refinancing Agreement, the parties undertook the following obligations:\n(a) JDD was to obtain JTC's approval and do all things necessary for the creation of a deed of assignment of the building agreement (\"the Assignment of Building Agreement\") between JDD and JTC and also execute a mortgage in favour of the plaintiff.\n(b) CPH was to provide the Investment Amount (defined as the amount due from JDD to the plaintiff together with another $5m for costs of variation works, legal and other costs associated with interim financing and contingencies) by 31 January 2010. The Investment Amount was to be paid into an Escrow Account by JDD within three days of receiving the money and the money was to be applied in paying off JDD's indebtedness to the plaintiff.\n(c) Once the above had been performed, the plaintiff would withdraw all adjudication proceedings that were still pending. It also agreed not to start legal proceedings against JDD for outstanding sums not paid. It would continue construction of the Data Centre unless JDD defaulted on its obligations under cl 1(c) of the Refinancing Agreement. The plaintiff agreed to obtain an extension of the adjudication process begun under the SOPA until the date of the JLL Extraordinary General Meeting (\"EGM\") or 31 January 2010, whichever date was earlier. This was subject to JDD performing its obligations under cl 1(c) of the Refinancing Agreement.\n19 On 11 December 2009, JDD executed the Assignment of Building Agreement in favour of the plaintiff. This document created a security interest in the Property in favour of the plaintiff. At the same time, JDD executed a mortgage in escrow over the Property in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe Assignment Agreement\n\n20 On 12 January 2010, the plaintiff entered into an agreement with CPH as assignee, Elchemi as guarantor and JDD as debtor. The recitals to this Agreement stated that JDD was in default of its payment obligations under the Construction Contract and that in connection with the investment that CPH intended to make in JDD, CPH was willing to undertake the payment obligations of JDD to the plaintiff, in return for an assignment by the plaintiff of its rights, title and benefits in and to the Construction Contract. By cl 2.1 of this Agreement (\"the CPH Assignment\"), CPH undertook to pay the plaintiff the sum of $154,984,800.40 on or before 28 January 2010. It also undertook certain other payment obligations in cll 2.2 and 2.3. By cl 4, in consideration of the various payments under cl 2, the plaintiff assigned to CPH from the date of payment, among other things, its rights and interest in the Construction Contract, and further agreed that upon receipt of certain payments it would execute a Deed of Discharge, Re-assignment and Release in respect of the Debenture, the Assignment of Building Agreement and the mortgage in escrow.\n21 The plaintiff's witnesses, Mr Kurzboeck and Mr Dedigama, did not explain in their affidavits of evidence-in-chief (\"AEIC\") what the plaintiff's reasons for entering into the CPH Assignment had been. Mr Ang explained in his AEIC that the plaintiff was concerned that the board of Japan Land might reject the Investment Agreement and frustrate the efforts to bring CPH into JDD. The point of the CPH Assignment was to allow CPH to pay the plaintiff and then obtain a right to claim payment from JDD under the Construction Contract.\n22 CPH did not pay the plaintiff any money on 28 January 2010. However, at that time the plaintiff took no action to terminate the CPH Assignment or the Investment Agreement. According to Mr Ang, this was because Elchemi was working closely with its strategic partner and also DBS Ltd to obtain financing for the investment. Everyone was optimistic that DBS Ltd would finance JDD, and the plaintiff and JDD were kept informed of the negotiations between Mr Ang and DBS Ltd.\nThe GST refund\n\n23 On 23 December 2009, JDD had filed a claim for a GST refund in the amount of $6,456,230.09. This amount was received from IRAS on 15 January 2010 and was paid into JDD's bank account with DBS Bank, Account No 003xxx (\"the DBS Account\"). The money was subsequently used to make various payments including:\n(a) $388,920.01 to Japan Asia being an interest payment on a loan of $12m which Japan Asia had made to JDD;\n(b) $151,377.41 being utility charges incurred by JDD;\n(c) $82,600 being property tax for the Data Centre;\n(d) $34,891 being salary for the staff of JDD;\n(e) $38,520 being payment to one of the consultants working on the Data Centre;\n(f) $334,478 to Japan Land in relation to a redemption of JDD's preferential shares.\n24 The plaintiff was unaware of the GST refund. It was not asked for its permission for the various payments that were made from the GST Refund and only found out about these much later.\nEnforcement of the Debenture\n\n25 On 9 March 2010, DBS Ltd made a formal offer to JDD of a loan facility of up to $227m. Mr Ang found some of the terms of that offer to be unacceptable and he rejected it. As a result, CPH was unable to fund the Investment Amount and the Refinancing Agreement between JDD and the plaintiff collapsed. The plaintiff then gave JDD notice that the CPH Assignment would be terminated with immediate effect unless CPH or Elchemi met their obligations under it. No payment was made by either CPH or Elchemi. On 12 March 2010, the plaintiff terminated the Refinancing Agreement. On 16 March 2010, the CPH Assignment was also terminated. The plaintiff then proceeded to extract the adjudication order it had obtained earlier under the SOPA and, on 22 March 2010, it issued JDD with a notice of default. Shortly thereafter, the plaintiff appointed receivers and managers pursuant to the Debenture. On 8 April 2010, at the instance of other creditors, the court appointed provisional liquidators for JDD.\n26 After their appointment, the receivers and managers took control of all JDD's assets including the Data Centre and the DBS Account. At that time, there was only $1,107,816.58 left in the DBS Account. The receivers and managers subsequently found out about the GST refund and the payments made from these funds.\n27 The receivers and managers sold the Data Centre by auction. The plaintiff was the sole bidder at the auction and bought the Data Centre for $145m. This amount was insufficient to settle the indebtedness of JDD to the plaintiff.\n28 At about the same time, the liquidators of JDD commenced OS 389 of 2010 (\"OS 389\") in which JDD was the plaintiff and M+W Singapore Pte Ltd, the plaintiff here, was the defendant. By OS 389, JDD challenged the validity of the Debenture and the appointment of the receivers and managers by the plaintiff. JDD sought to recover the Data Centre\/its proceeds and the balance standing to the credit of the DBS Account. I heard OS 389 and delivered judgment in March 2011. I dismissed JDD's claims and held, amongst other things, that the Debenture was valid and enforceable.\nCauses of action\n\n29 The plaintiff seeks to recover the moneys spent from the GST Refund on the basis of three distinct and alternative causes of action:\n(a) dishonest assistance in a breach of trust;\n(b) inducement of breach of contract; and\n(c) fraudulent trading.\nI will take these in turn.\nDishonest assistance\n\n30 The elements of a claim in dishonest assistance are:\n(a) The existence of a trust;\n(b) A breach of that trust;\n(c) Assistance rendered by the defendant towards the breach;\n(d) A finding that the assistance rendered by the defendant was dishonest.\nThus, the issues that have to be determined in relation to this cause of action are related to the satisfaction of the foregoing elements.\nWas there a trust?\n\n31 The plaintiff's position is that because of the provisions of the Debenture, a trust existed over the Monetary Claims (including the GST Refund) in favour of the plaintiff. Further, by reason of my judgment in OS 389, this court has confirmed this trust and the defendants are estopped by the principles of res judicata from contesting those findings.\n32 In OS 389, I held that:\n(a) the GST Refund clearly fell within the definition of a Monetary Claim in the Debenture (at [80]);\n(b) under cl 10.1(a) of the Debenture, JDD was obliged, on receipt of the Monetary Claim, to pay the same into the Claims Account and to use the same for the purpose of repaying the plaintiff only. JDD had no authority to use such Monetary Claim for any other purpose whatsoever (at [81]); and\n(c) JDD's action in paying the GST Refund into the DBS Account was a breach of the Debenture and did not convert the fixed charge over the GST Refund into a floating charge. Instead, because the GST Refund was utilised in a manner contrary to the fixed charge, at law it was held on a constructive trust for the plaintiff. In addition, under cl 10.1(a) of the Debenture, a Monetary Claim that was received by the plaintiff was to be held on trust by it for the plaintiff until it was paid into the Claims Account. Thus, whilst it was in the DBS Account, the GST Refund was still held on trust for the plaintiff.\n33 If the holdings above are binding on the defendants in this case, then the first two elements of the cause of action would be met: there would be a trust over the GST Refund in favour of the plaintiff and there would have been a breach of that trust by JDD in so far as a substantial portion of the GST Refund was spent to settle claims of parties other than the plaintiff without the plaintiff's consent. The defendants, however, submit that res judicata is not applicable and that the plaintiff cannot prove its case by pointing to OS 389 or the evidence in that suit.\n34 As enunciated in Goh Nellie v Goh Lian Teck [2007] 1 SLR(R) 453 (\"Nellie Goh\") at [17]-[24], the doctrine of res judicata encompasses three distinct but inter-related principles: cause of action estoppel, issue estoppel and abuse of process. The first prevents a party from asserting or denying against the other party the existence of a cause of action. The second allows a previous decision to be invoked as having determined an essential step in a separate issue so that further consideration of that issue is foreclosed. The third prevents parties from changing the form of the proceedings in a bid to re-litigate issues previously decided. The second and third principles apply in this case.\n35 In its statement of claim, the plaintiff stated that it intended to rely on the judgment in OS 389 to show that:\n(a) the payment of the GST Refund into the DBS Account was a breach of the terms of the Debenture and resulted in JDD holding the moneys on a constructive trust for the plaintiff; and\n(b) JDD had spent at least $5,348,413.55 out of the GST Refund in breach of contract and\/or in breach of trust.\n36 The defendant says that the plaintiff cannot prove its case by pointing to OS 389 or the contents of the affidavit in OS 389 and had failed to show how the judgment in OS 389 is relevant to this action. However, as Nellie Goh itself holds, findings of fact in a previous decision can be relied on when the judgment is final and conclusive on the merits; the judgment is from a court of competent jurisdiction; there is identity between the parties to the two actions; and there is identity of subject matter in the two proceedings. These elements are substantially fulfilled: the judgment in OS 389 is final and conclusive on the merits, it is from a court of competent jurisdiction and in relation to the subject matter of the GST Refund and the nature of the charge of the GST Refund, there is an identity of subject matter between OS 389 and the present action. The main difference between the two is that there is no identity of parties in that although the plaintiff here was a party to OS 389, the defendants here were not. However, the defendants here could be said to be the privies of the defendant in OS 389, being the directors of JDD. Further, the first defendant gave evidence on behalf of JDD in OS 389 and was aware of the arguments made there in relation to the nature of the charge created by the Debenture over the Monetary Claims and the GST Refund. It was argued there that the Monetary Claims were not subject to a fixed charge and that GST Refund was not a Monetary Claim. Similar arguments have been made here.\n37 I am of the opinion that because of the identity of the subject matter in the two proceedings and the part that the defendants here played as directors of the defendant in OS 389, there is issue estoppel in relation to the holdings cited in [32] above. This is notwithstanding the fact that the defendants here were not direct parties to OS 389. Even if this determination is incorrect, the defendants are still unable to dispute those holdings because my decision in OS 389 operates as a judgment in rem and as a result res judicata would still apply. A judgment in rem is one that declares the rights and title to a property to all the world. Every judgment in rem is conclusive and binding upon the world at large and is not limited in its binding effect to those who were parties to the proceedings and their privies (see Kwa Ban Cheong v Kuah Boon Sek [2003] 3 SLR(R) 644 at [38]). In this case, the judgment in OS 389 determined, as against all the world, the rights and interests of the plaintiff in Monetary Claims, which included the GST Refund, as vested in it by the Debenture.\n38 Accordingly, I hold that the defendants here are estopped from denying that the GST Refund was a Monetary Claim or that as such it was subject to a fixed charge in favour of the plaintiff and that JDD held it on trust for the plaintiff. This trust was a trust that arose on the terms of the Debenture itself (ie, cl 10.1(a)) and also by law.\nWas there a breach of trust and did the defendants render assistance?\n\n39 These two elements can be dealt with briefly. The answer to the first question is plain: the Debenture provided a fixed charge over the GST Refund and therefore the money had to be kept for the plaintiff and could not be paid to a third party without the plaintiff's consent. The plaintiff had no prior knowledge of the various payments made by JDD from the GST Refund and did not consent to them. Such payments were, thus, in breach of trust by JDD. As for the second question, the only way that the payment in breach of trust could be made was if they were authorised by the defendants who were the sole directors of JDD and, more to the point here, the operators of the DBS Account. The defendants signed the cheques and authorised the remittances that were made from the DBS Account and resulted in payment of money from the GST Refund to parties other than the plaintiff. Thus, they assisted in the breach of trust committed by JDD.\nWas the assistance rendered by the defendants dishonest?\n\n40 There are a number of points that arise in relation to this question. First, however, it may be helpful to briefly set out the law on how dishonesty is assessed in connection with this cause of action.\nThe law\n\n41 In George Raymond Zage III v Ho Chi Kwong [2010] 2 SLR 589 (\"Zage\") at [22], it was held by the Court of Appeal that for a defendant to be liable for dishonest assistance, he must have such knowledge of the irregular shortcomings of the transaction that ordinary honest people would consider it to be a breach of standards of honest conduct if he failed to adequately query them. In formulating this principle, the Court of Appeal accepted Lord Hoffmann's statement of the law in Barlow Clowes International Ltd (in liquidation) v Eurotrust International Ltd [2006] 1 WLR 1476 (\"Barlow Clowes\"). Barlow Clowes was a decision of the Privy Council and there Lord Hoffmann clarified previous authority in relation to whether the test of dishonesty should be objective or subjective. At [10], Lord Hoffmann stated that:\n... Although a dishonest state of mind is a subjective mental state, the standard by which the law determines whether it is dishonest is objective. If by ordinary standards a defendant's mental state would be characterised as dishonest, it is irrelevant that the defendant judges by different standards. ...\n42 Therefore, the analysis is a two-stage one, the first being subjective and the second objective (Susan Barkehall Thomas, \"Defining (Or Refining) The Meaning Of Dishonesty After Twinsectra\" [2006] SJLS 459 at p 462). Two questions must be asked:\n(a) What did the defendant know of the transaction?\n(b) Does participation in the transaction with this knowledge offend ordinary standards?\nIt is only when both limbs are satisfied that the defendant's dishonesty will be established.\n43 Further, accessory liability can still be found even though the assisting third party did not obtain any benefit himself: Royal Brunei Airlines Sdn Bhd v Philip Tan Kok Ming [1995] 2 AC 378 (\"Royal Brunei\") at 382.\n44 The facts of Royal Brunei are relevant because of their similarity to those of the current case. In this respect, I cannot accept the defendants' submission that they are too different to be used as a comparison.\n45 In Royal Brunei, Royal Brunei Airlines Sdn Bhd appointed Borneo Leisure Travel Sdn Bhd (\"BLT\") as its agent for selling passenger and cargo transportation. BLT was owned by Philip Tan Kok Ming (\"Philip Tan\") and his wife, who were the sole directors and shareholders of the company. Under the terms of its appointment, BLT was to account to the airline for the sale receipts and would be paid a sales commission for its services.\n46 Subsequently, it was discovered that the sales proceeds were not deposited into a separate account but paid into BLT's ordinary current account with its bank. When the airline demanded payment of the money, BLT could not pay. The airline sued Philip Tan for the sums owed because he knew that there was an express trust of the money and yet had authorised the use of the money for BLT's ordinary business purposes, paying salaries, overheads and other expenses, and keeping down its bank overdraft. He was found liable for dishonest assistance because he caused or permitted the company to use the money, of which it was trustee, in a manner he knew was unauthorised. The Privy Council held that \"[t]he defendant was the company, and his state of mind is to be imputed to the company\". In the present case, the plaintiff seeks to draw a parallel regarding the use of the GST Refund by JDD.\nThe defendants' knowledge\n\n47 The first inquiry therefore must be as to what each of the defendants knew about JDD's obligations to the plaintiff and the status of Monetary Claims under the Debenture. These are factual issues and they are hotly contested by the parties.\n48 The plaintiff submits that:\n(a) the defendants knew or ought to have known that the Debenture secured all present and future assets of JDD for the benefit of the plaintiff; and\n(b) the defendants knew or ought to have known that they were spending an asset of JDD in breach of the Debenture.\n49 The defendants submit that:\n(a) both of them were salaried employees, they were not paid additional remuneration for the work and responsibilities they had undertaken for JDD and received no benefit from any of the payments made;\n(b) they were not aware of cl 10 of the Debenture at the time they signed it on behalf of JDD;\n(c) after the signing of the Debenture, all parties had agreed not to enforce it, or at least the evidence showed that there was no attempt to enforce it and it remained in the background with no one being concerned about its terms and conditions;\n(d) no reasonable director would have given much importance to the Debenture because of the events that took place after it was signed;\n(e) there was a collateral understanding that the Debenture was not to be enforced and that it was provided so that the plaintiff would continue construction work without resorting to SOPA; and\n(f) at all material times after the signing of the Debenture, they were trying their best to get CPH involved as an investor and always obtain approval from Mr Ang on behalf of CPH before making any payment from the DBS Account.\n50 Before I deal with the defendants' knowledge, I observe that the fact that the defendants were salaried employees who received no additional remuneration for acting as directors of JDD is not relevant to the consideration of their liability. As Royal Brunei makes clear, it is equally irrelevant that they received no personal benefit from any of the payments made.\n51 I now turn to what exactly the defendants knew about the contents and effect of the Debenture. Their alleged ignorance of its contents at the time it was executed is supported by the fact that JDD was supplied with that document (together with the Security Undertaking) on 27 October 2008, just a day before it was signed. The plaintiff, through Mr Dedigama, insisted that it be signed the next day despite the first defendant informing him that JDD's lawyers could not review the document in such a short space of time. The second defendant was flying back from Japan to Singapore at the time the document was sent over and had no opportunity to read the Debenture and the Security Undertaking before they were signed. Both the defendants were, however, aware that the documentation they were signing was intended to create security over the assets of JDD in favour of the plaintiff.\n52 Dealing with the first defendant, he is a qualified and very experienced accountant. He testified that it was \"common knowledge\" that a debenture creates a fixed and floating charge over the assets of the company that executes it. Further, according to the minutes of the board meeting of Japan Land held on 28 October 2009, the first defendant, as chairman of the meeting, explained to board members that it had been convened to seek the board's approval for JDD, Japan Land's wholly-owned subsidiary, to enter into the Debenture and Security Undertaking in favour of the plaintiff. He also briefed the board on the key terms of the documents and in this connection stated that the Debenture created a fixed and floating charge over all the present and future assets of JDD in favour of the plaintiff. Whilst the first defendant did not draft these minutes, he confirmed in court that he had read, checked and signed them subsequently. He confirmed that they were a correct record of what was discussed at the meeting although later he resiled somewhat from that admission. In relation to his knowledge, the first defendant came across as evasive and untruthful.\n53 The first defendant's evidence during the trial was that he had received drafts of the Debenture and the Security Undertaking on 27 October 2008 and had read them \"very very briefly\". He was asked if he had been able to understand the terms of the documents and his reply was \"I don't think so\". This reply was inconsistent with his evidence that it was common knowledge that a debenture creates a fixed and floating charge over assets and he knew this before the board meeting. He subsequently clarified that in this case he understood the Debenture created a fixed and floating charge over the Data Centre only. He specifically said he was not aware that it created such charges over the present and future assets of JDD. However, when he was pressed on the point, he admitted that at the time he signed the Debenture he understood that it created a fixed and floating charge over all the present and future assets of JDD.\n54 This knowledge of the extent of the Debenture must have been reinforced after its execution. First, Rodyk acted for JDD in relation to the Debenture and although Rodyk was not able to advise JDD on the contents of the documents before they were executed, the firm was available thereafter to answer any questions the directors might have had on the documents. Secondly, the plaintiff's lawyers prepared a \"Statement Containing Particulars of Charge\" (\"the Statement\") in respect of the Debenture for filing with the relevant authority and sent the same to Rodyk. The first defendant admitted in court that he had received e-mails from Rodyk attaching a copy of the draft Statement. The particulars in the Statement referring to the charges created include \"a charge on book debts of the company\". The first defendant said that he did not recall discussing the draft particulars of the Statement with Rodyk and also claimed that he did not ask Rodyk for any advice on the terms of the Debenture.\n55 I find it difficult to believe that with all the documents before him and the part that he played in their approval and execution, the first defendant, a qualified accountant with many years of experience in the business world, did not know or understand the contents of the Debenture or appreciate that it created a fixed charge on the book debts of JDD. The fact that he did not seek any advice from Rodyk on the terms of the document, even after executing it, indicates to me that he must have understood what he had signed, albeit perhaps after he did so. In his AEIC, the first defendant claimed that he had always been aware of his duty as a director of JDD and had taken care to seek legal advice on all important affairs of JDD. I do not accept that an experienced director like the first defendant would have failed to ask for advice had he not understood what the Debenture provided.\n56 As for the second defendant, he had attended the meeting in Japan at which Mr Kurzboeck demanded security in return for the plaintiff continuing to carry on work on the Data Centre. Therefore he was aware of the plaintiff's position. While he did not see the draft documents which detailed the security required, Mr Kobayashi who was an executive of Japan Land, sent an e-mail to the second defendant and to Mr Ono after sighting a copy of the Debenture. This e-mail said:\nI have read it. The draft done by the lawyer is legally sound but we need to adjust the interests of the parties as follows. The problems in the contract for the security interests are that Zander [i.e. M+W] wished to add everything (refer to Clause 3.1) and I am wondering if this will infringe on the Elchemi's security interest creation.\n57 During cross-examination, the second defendant claimed that while he did read the e-mail from Mr Kobayashi, he did not bother to give it any thought or seek any clarification from Mr Kobayashi or the first defendant as to what it meant. The second defendant did, however, concede that he should have understood that by the phrase \"Zander wished to add everything\" that the plaintiff wanted security over all JDD's assets. More significantly, the second defendant admitted that by the time the Refinancing Agreement was signed on 25 November 2009, he would have read the terms of the Debenture. He did not confirm that he understood it, saying that he was no lawyer and did not know certain words. However, the second defendant conceded that he had a \"general understanding\" but not each word or each sentence. In his affidavit, he had stated that the Refinancing Agreement was to secure the Debenture (because it had been hurriedly executed by JDD) and that therefore the very first clause of the Refinancing Agreement was \"the clause to secure the Debenture\". It should be noted that cl 1(a) of the Refinancing Agreement states that JDD acknowledged and agreed that the bizfiling of the Debenture was lawfully and properly carried out and that the Debenture was kept at the registered office of JDD and was open to the inspection of any creditor or member of JDD. The second defendant therefore was fully aware by 25 November 2009 that the Debenture was a valid document and that its clauses bound the company. This being the case, he had a duty as a director of JDD to acquaint himself with its terms and to understand its full import. As in the case of the first defendant, he had every opportunity to ask Rodyk for advice on its terms if he did not understand them.\n58 Apart from the Refinancing Agreement, the defendants also executed other documents which confirmed the enforceability of the Debenture. On 3 November 2009, the Investment Agreement was signed between JDD, Japan Land and CPH. In cl 3.1.10, completion of the investment by CPH was expressly made subject to the plaintiff having agreed to the termination of the Debenture, the security undertaking and all other security and other agreements granted in relation thereto. On 12 January 2010, JDD signed the Assignment Agreement with the plaintiff, CPH and Elchemi. In this document, CPH agreed to undertake the payment obligations of JDD to the plaintiff in return for, amongst other things, an agreement on the part of JDD to execute a deed of discharge, reassignment and release in respect of, inter alia, the Debenture.\n59 Thus, during the period from 28 October 2009 up to 12 January 2010, both the defendants signed, on behalf of JDD, documents which referred to the Debenture in terms that made it plain that this was a valid and enforceable obligation of JDD which would have to be discharged for the investment by CPH to take place. The defendants admitted that they took advice from Rodyk on the terms of each of those documents. They would therefore have understood the implications of the documents.\n60 On the evidence, I find that the first defendant knew, at all material times, and definitely before the receipt by JDD of the GST Refund, that the Debenture covered all book debts belonging to JDD and that the same were subject to a fixed charge. As for the second defendant, he was aware that the Debenture covered all assets of JDD and, if he had taken advice in relation to clauses that were unclear to him as he should have, would have been informed and known that book debts formed part of the assets of JDD and were subject to a charge in favour of the plaintiff.\n61 The plaintiff submits that on the facts of this case there are only two possibilities. Either:\n(a) the defendants were well aware that the Debenture created a trust over the GST Refund in favour of the plaintiff and prevented them from disposing of the GST Refund for purposes other than repaying the plaintiff, but proceeded regardless; or\n(b) they had good grounds to suspect that the expenditure was not permitted or at least that they were not permitted to freely dispose JDD's assets, given that the plaintiff had security over all of JDD's assets, such that ordinary honest people would consider it to be a breach of standards of honest conduct if the defendants failed to make further adequate queries before disposing of the funds.\nThe plaintiff further says that in both cases the defendants' conduct would be dishonest.\n62 In my view, the first defendant fell within the first category. However, even if this is not completely supported by the evidence, there is no doubt in my mind that he fell within the second category as well. As for the second defendant, in my judgment his failure (if indeed he was telling the truth) to obtain an explanation for those parts of the Debenture which he did not understand, was reckless. He therefore fell within the second category in that he had good grounds to believe that JDD was not able to freely dispose of all of its assets. I go on to consider whether the inference of dishonesty that I have drawn can be displaced by certain matters on which the defendants rely in answer to the plaintiff's case.\nThe defendants' rebuttals\n\n63 The defendants have made two types of submissions as to why they should not be considered dishonest in any event. The first category is set out at [49(c)]-[49(e)] above and the second is set out at [49(f)] above.\n64 The first category pertains to the enforceability of the Debenture and consists of the allegations that: (a) that the parties had agreed not to enforce the Debenture; (b) there was a collateral understanding that it was not to be enforced; (c) no one was concerned about its terms and conditions; and (d) no reasonable director would have given much importance to it because of the events that took place after it was signed.\n65 The defendants pleaded that there was a collateral agreement between JDD and the plaintiff that the Debenture would not be enforced by the plaintiff until the completion of the Data Centre and the completion of the Investment Agreement. This was an oral agreement that arose from an assurance by Mr Dedigama on 28 October 2009 that there would be no enforcement of the Debenture and Security Undertaking. According to the first defendant, Mr Dedigama said that he only needed the security to reassure his head office in Vienna. On 6 November 2009, the plaintiff received a letter from Rodyk (\"Rodyk's 6 November letter\") which stated that the basis on which the documents were executed by JDD were: (a) to allow the plaintiff to receive continued funding from its head office for the Data Centre; and (b) it was never the intent of JDD, and Mr Dedigama was aware of this, for the documents to take full effect in accordance with their terms pending JDD's negotiations with the plaintiff and Elchemi for a final resolution of the funding issues for the Data Centre.\n66 The plaintiff's position, naturally, is that no collateral agreement existed and that at all material times it was intended that the Debenture would be a legally effective and enforcement security and would be discharged only when payment was received from JDD.\n67 The plaintiff also points out that the defendants' explanation of their understanding of the collateral agreement shifted many times:\n(a) In their Defences, both defendants pleaded that the plaintiff would not enforce the Debenture pending completion of the Data Centre and completion of the Investment Agreement.\n(b) In their AEICs, both defendants assert that they were assured by Mr Dedigama \"that there would be no enforcement of the Debenture and [Security Undertaking]\" (the implication of this was that there would be no enforcement at all).\n(c) In the Rodyk 6 November letter, it was said that the security documents were \"not meant to be registered nor enforced against our client. Once executed the two documents were not meant to take effect pending our client's negotiations with your client and a potential investor, Elchemi Group, for a final resolution of the funding issues for the [Data Centre]\". It should be noted that this was also the description of the alleged collateral agreement which was asserted in OS 389. In court, Mr Ang acknowledged that JDD's negotiations with Elchemi had reached their conclusion on 3 November 2009. This would have meant that after 3 November 2009, the documents could be registered and enforced, and therefore the Rodyk version was at odds with the versions put forward by the defendants in their pleadings and AEICs.\n(d) In court, the defendants refused to acknowledge inconsistencies between the three versions of the collateral agreement. However, they conceded in cross-examination that the Debenture was enforceable even if the Investment Agreement was not completed. Thus, they expressly disavowed on the stand the purported collateral agreement that they had pleaded and also asserted in their AEICs.\n68 I am satisfied that no collateral agreement existed in the terms as pleaded. It would not be logical to have an agreement not to enforce the Debenture until both the Data Centre and the Investment Agreement had been completed because the completion of the latter document would have meant that the plaintiff had been paid off and once this happened there would be nothing to enforce. It must have been this recognition that impelled the defendants when questioned in court to resile from that part of their pleadings. I am, however, also satisfied that there was no general agreement not to enforce the security documents at all.\n69 It should be noted that on 27 October 2009 Mr Dedigama sent an e-mail to the first defendant regarding the execution of the documents in which he said:\nPlease note that the debenture and security undertaking agreement are purely there to ensure that we do not proceed with the issuance of a notice as we are entitled to under the Security of Payment Act. The documents are there only to protect us in the event you do not make the payments as agreed.\nIt can be seen from this that the plaintiff's main intention in procuring the security from JDD was to have protection in the event that JDD did not make payment to the plaintiff as agreed. This sentence can by no means be read as an agreement not to enforce and, having put the plaintiff's position so clearly on paper, I do not accept that on 28 October 2009 Mr Dedigama said anything to contradict or adversely affect that position. I note that in court the second defendant confirmed that what Mr Dedigama had said on 28 October 2009 was that the Debenture would not take effect if the investors' money came in. Such a statement was consistent with the email indicating the Debenture was required as protection in the event of non-payment.\n70 The Rodyk 6 November letter did provide some support to the defendants but its weight was undermined by JDD's failure to respond to the plaintiff's solicitors' strong rebuttal dated 10 November 2009. This was a four-page letter setting out the parties' actions and discussions in some detail and asserting that: (a) none of the alleged representations had been made by Mr Dedigama; (b) there was no understanding that the security documents were not meant to be registered or to take effect; (c) the security documents reflected the full understanding of the parties; and (d) JDD knew and accepted that the Debenture was intended to be registered and take full effect as security for the plaintiff's benefit. The first defendant testified that he had instructed Rodyk to respond to the 10 November 2009 letter but when Rodyk's draft reply was received by him, Mr Ang did not want it sent out because he did not want to upset the plaintiff for fear doing so would jeopardise the Investment Agreement. This testimony was at odds with what the first defendant had said in OS 389 which was to the effect that he had been of the opinion that there was no need to respond to the 10 November 2009 letter as JDD had consistently maintained that the security documents were never meant to take full effect and this position had been set out clearly in Rodyk's 6 November letter. When the first defendant was asked why he had given different evidence in OS 389, he said that he did not find it necessary then to mention that Mr Ang had told him not to send out the reply and the position then had been different because he was just a witness in OS 389. If the first defendant's evidence in this case was the truth, then it shows that he was aware that the plaintiff did not accept JDD's position on the enforceability of the documents but, nevertheless, kept his peace instead of setting the record straight and protecting JDD's position. This does not inspire confidence in the strength of his belief.\n71 It is also worth pointing out that in the Security Undertaking JDD agreed to pay the plaintiff, on or before 2 November 2009 or such later date as the plaintiff may agree to, at least $24m as part payment of the \"Overdue Amounts\" which JDD acknowledged as being $59,382,895.95 (excluding GST) as at 27 October 2009. The Security Undertaking also provided that if such payment was not made, the plaintiff would be entitled to stop work on the Data Centre and this would be without prejudice to its rights to take any legal action or enforce any of its rights under the Construction Contract. No payment was made on 2 November 2009. On the same evening, one of Mr Dedigama's colleagues sent JDD an e-mail demanding payment of the outstanding sums due. The very next day, as alluded to earlier, the plaintiff commenced action under SOPA. In my judgment, the plaintiff's actions demonstrated to JDD its intention that the Debenture should secure JDD's payment obligations and that if JDD did not meet those obligations, the plaintiff would be entitled to take whatever action it deemed fit to protect itself.\n72 Whilst the plaintiff did not take any drastic steps to enforce the Debenture in November 2009 or thereafter, it must be remembered that it was working to protect its security by obtaining JTC's consent to the mortgage and Assignment of Building Agreement. More generally, from a commercial point of view, to the extent that the plaintiff saw the potential for CPH to complete its investment and pay off the debt owed to it, the plaintiff must have seen this as a better option than enforcement. In this connection, the plaintiff procured the registration of the charges with ACRA. Such registration was not challenged by JDD after it signed the Refinancing Agreement on 25 November 2009. As mentioned earlier, this document expressly provided that bilateral agreements between the plaintiff and JDD including the Debenture would remain fully binding and enforceable. Thus, even if there had been an oral collateral agreement in October 2009, such agreement would have been superseded by the terms of the Refinancing Agreement.\n73 In this connection, I observe that the only agreement which the plaintiff entered in relation to enforcement was that contained in and conditioned by the terms of the Refinancing Agreement. This agreement contained three sets of obligations as follows:\n(a) JDD agreed, amongst other things, that the registration of the Statement with ACRA was lawful, that it would obtain JDD's approval for the mortgage and Assignment of Building Agreement, that within three days of receipt (and in any event no later than 31 January 2010) of the Investment Amount (basically the amount owing from JDD plus an extra $5m) from CPH it would place this in an escrow account and execute a charge over the escrow account in favour of the plaintiff, and that the money in the escrow account would only be used to discharge its payment obligations to the plaintiff.\n(b) CPH represented and warranted that it had the capacity to raise the Investment Amount and would use the same to fulfil its obligations to JDD pursuant to the Investment Agreement. It would do so by 31 January 2010 by, inter alia, transferring such sums of money to JDD as would be sufficient for JDD to repay the plaintiff.\n(c) The plaintiff agreed that when all moneys due to it under the Construction Contract had been paid, it would withdraw pending adjudication proceedings and release and terminate the Debenture, discharge the Assignment of Building Agreement and mortgage, and withdraw the caveats lodged against the Property. It also agreed to approach the adjudicator appointed for the SOPA proceedings to request an extension of the adjudication process up to 31 January 2010 or the date of the Japan Land EGM to approve the investment by CPH, whichever was earlier.\n74 It would be noted that the plaintiff was willing to allow time for the terms of the Investment Agreement to be accomplished and in that respect was willing to suspend the adjudication proceedings that were pending then. The cut-off date for achievement of the Investment Agreement was 31 January 2010. Until then, although it was not stated expressly, it could be implied that as long as JDD complied with its obligations to get JTC's approval for the mortgage and Assignment of Building Agreement, the plaintiff would not take enforcement action under the Debenture or any other security document. This agreement to withhold enforcement action did not, however, mean that the Debenture was not a valid and enforceable document. Further, it did not mean that the plaintiff had agreed that JDD need not comply with its obligations under the Debenture in respect of the assets charged by that document.\n75 I therefore reject the defendants' submission that the parties had orally agreed not to enforce the Debenture and that no one was concerned about its terms and conditions. The defendants did not give a specific date for the conclusion of the oral agreement but, in view of the evidence, such agreement could not have come about after 6 November 2009 since it was contradicted by the plaintiff's solicitors' letter of 10 November 2009. Any oral agreement concluded before the signing of the Refinancing Agreement on 25 November 2009 would then have been totally superseded.\n76 I accept that from November 2009 until March 2010 there was no attempt to enforce the Debenture but that is a neutral fact which does not of itself imply that there was an agreement not to enforce the Debenture at all. The evidence shows that the plaintiff was keen to be paid off and was convinced that the most efficient route to achieving this aim was to work with CPH and JDD. That was a commercial decision that the plaintiff was entitled to make and it did so in the knowledge that it had enforceable security should payment eventually not be made.\nThe Assignment Agreement\n\n77 The defendants also pleaded that the plaintiff did not have any right or interest under the Debenture from 12 January 2010, when the Assignment Agreement was signed, to 17 March 2010 when the Assignment Agreement was terminated, and therefore was not entitled to any money received by JDD during that period. The particulars of this pleading stated that the plaintiff had assigned its rights under the Construction Contract to CPH and the obligation of the defendants, as JDD directors, were therefore to CPH and not to the plaintiff.\n78 I do not accept this point. It is clear from a proper reading of the Assignment Agreement that the assignment it contained only took effect from the date of receipt by the plaintiff of various payments to be made by CPH as the assignee under cl 2 of the Assignment Agreement. Among these payment obligations was the liability to pay the plaintiff $154,984,800.40 on or before 28 January 2010. This sum was not paid on 28 January 2010 or on any date thereafter. CPH also undertook to deposit $50m in an escrow account by 28 January 2010. This was not done either. The Assignment Agreement provided that upon the receipt of the sum of $154,984,800.40 and a charge over the escrow account, the plaintiff would execute a deed of discharge, reassignment and release in respect of \"the Debtor Security Documents\" which included the Debenture. Pending execution of this deed, nothing in the Assignment Agreement was to \"confer on JDD, CPH or Elchemi any rights to require [the plaintiff] to refrain from exercising any of its rights under the Debtor Security Documents or be construed as a waiver of any of [the plaintiff's] rights under the Debtor Security Documents\" (cl 4.3).\n79 Therefore, pursuant to the Assignment Agreement, JDD remained bound by all the security obligations under the Debenture until and unless CPH made payment as obliged and the plaintiff executed a deed of reassignment, release and discharge.\n80 In court, the defendants submitted that they were informed of the principal terms of the Assignment Agreement in December 2009 by way of a term sheet circulated by the plaintiff's in-house counsel. The second defendant admitted that he had understood from the term sheet that CPH was to make payment for the assignment. The first defendant, after quite a bit of prevarication, also admitted that his understanding of the term sheet was that the assignment was to become effective when CPH paid the outstanding amount due to the plaintiff. JDD itself received legal advice on the Debenture and the first defendant was the one who was in contact with the lawyers. If he did not understand the terms, they would have explained the same to him.\n81 I am satisfied that in fact both defendants knew and understood that any transfer of interest from the plaintiff to CPH would only occur when CPH made payment of the outstanding amount of $154,984,800.40. They were also aware that no payment had been made by CPH up to 17 March 2010. Therefore, they could not have honestly believed during the relevant period between 12 January 2010 and 17 March 2010 that the plaintiff had no rights under the Debenture at that time.\nBelief in CPH\n\n82 This argument is foreshadowed in [49(f)] above. The defendants submit that they honestly believed that CPH would be able to provide funding and repay the plaintiff. I accept that submission to a certain extent. It was clear from the conduct of CPH and its director, Mr Ang, that CPH was very keen to invest in JDD. This was shown not only by the various documents that CPH signed but also by Mr Ang's conduct and assurances. However, CPH did fail to come up with the amount it had promised to pay the plaintiff in November 2009 and the defendants must have realised that CPH's ability to invest was contingent on it obtaining funding and that its own resources were not vast. As experienced businessmen, the defendants must have realised by 31 January 2010, at the latest, when CPH failed to meet its obligations under the Refinancing Agreement and did not come up with the funds needed to repay the plaintiff, that CPH was having difficulty and the Investment Agreement might not be completed. This should have engendered more caution on their part with respect to the propriety of acting on Mr Ang's instructions. In any case, the fact that the defendants always obtained Mr Ang's approval prior to making any payment from the DBS Account is immaterial. Mr Ang was not authorised to approve the expenditure of money that was held on trust for the plaintiff.\n83 Further, even if the defendants were entitled to believe completely in CPH's ability to undertake the investment and repay the plaintiff, this does not absolve the defendants from the consequences of using the charged moneys to pay third parties. In Royal Brunei, Lord Nicholls observed at 393 that:\nThe Court of Appeal held that it was not established that B.L.T. was guilty of fraud or dishonesty in relation to the amounts it held for the airline. Their Lordships understand that by this the Court of Appeal meant that it was not established that the defendant intended to defraud the airline. The defendant hoped, maybe expected, to be able to pay the airline, but the money was lost in the ordinary course of a poorly-run business with heavy overhead expenses. These facts are beside the point. The defendant had no right to employ the money in the business at all. That was the breach of trust. The company's inability to pay the airline was the consequence of that breach of trust. [emphasis added]\nHonest belief\n\n84 The defendants also argue that the various expenses that JDD paid with funds from the DBS Account were either for the benefit of the Data Centre and required to preserve the security under the Debenture, or were necessary for other reasons. As a general observation, this argument does not excuse the unauthorised application of funds. Where payments were necessary to preserve the security under the Debenture, the defendants could have notified the plaintiff of the same and obtained the plaintiff's approval for payment. It is highly unlikely that the plaintiff would have refused to authorise payment for items like property tax and insurance premiums. Where the payments related to JDD's other obligations, the plaintiff should still have been notified and if it had refused authorisation, such refusal would have had to be obeyed.\n85 Quite apart from the question of authority from the plaintiff, in my view, there are a number of items which an objective person would have realised had nothing to do with the security and that the plaintiff was very likely to refuse to agree to payment of the same. In those cases especially, on the objective standard, the defendants were acting dishonestly in authorising payment without reference to the plaintiff. Many of these payments were made after 31 January 2010 when CPH was in default of its obligations under the Refinancing Agreement and the prospects of completion of the Investment Agreement were more uncertain.\n86 The particular payments which I consider the defendants could not honestly have believed to be in the interest of preserving the security are the following:\n(a) Payment of $300,000 on 14 January 2010 to CPH as 10% of its management fee payable for managing the Data Centre.\n(b) $2.98m paid on 25 January 2010 for fitting out works in the Data Centre (these were needed for future business of the Data Centre, not its physical condition as security).\n(c) $334,478.69 paid to Japan Land on 4 February 2010 in relation to interest due on some preference shares. The second defendant's explanation was that this was done so that the Investment Agreement was not held up but the necessity for this payment at that time is not obvious. The first defendant had testified that Japan Land was not demanding payment.\n(d) $300,000 paid to Japan Land in respect of interest on a loan given to JDD by Japan Land. CPH had taken over the debt and payment was allegedly needed to prevent Japan Land from suing CPH and upsetting the investment. Again, this payment had nothing to do with the Data Centre per se and there was no evidence that there was a serious likelihood of CPH actually being sued. In any case, at the time payment was made, CPH was already in default of its obligations under the Refinancing Agreement and, had they thought about it, the defendants would have realised that the plaintiff was unlikely to authorise such payment.\n(e) The sum of $200,000 paid to DBS Bank as a fund-raising fee on 23 February 2010. This fee was payable by CPH and there was no legal obligation on JDD to pay it. The payment was not necessary to safeguard the Data Centre.\n(f) Substantial payments were made to JDD's consultants for services that had already been rendered. These companies could have sued JDD but they had no claim against the Data Centre and it was therefore wrong, in the light of the security given to the plaintiff, for JDD to prefer these consultants over its obligations to the plaintiff by using the plaintiff's money to settle their bills.\nSummary\n\n87 For the reasons given above, I have come to the conclusion that the defendants dishonestly assisted JDD in its breach of trust when it applied moneys from the DBS Account towards payment of JDD's obligations without the prior consent of the plaintiff. I also find that the defendants are not entitled to defend the claim on the basis of the defences pleaded. Accordingly, I hold the defendants liable jointly and severally for the plaintiff's claim.\nInducement of breach of contract\n\n88 For the defendants to be liable for inducing a breach of contract between JDD and the plaintiff, the plaintiff must show that:\n(a) the defendants knew of the contract and intended for it to be breached;\n(b) the defendants induced the breach; and\n(c) the contract was breached and damage was suffered.\nDid the defendants know of the contract and intend for it to be breached?\n\n89 There is no dispute that as JDD's directors, the defendants knew about the Debenture and Security Undertaking. I have also found that they knew or were in a position to know the import of the Debenture in relation to Monetary Claims. The dispute is whether the defendants intended for the Debenture to be breached.\n90 On intention, Tribune Investment Trust Inc v Soosan Trading Co Ltd [2000] 2 SLR(R) 407 (\"Tribune Investment Trust\") at [17] held that the inquiry into the procurer's intention was an objective determination and the defendant must be found to have intended to interfere with the plaintiff's contractual rights knowingly. Normally, this would involve some deliberate conduct by the defendant in order for the action to succeed. The state of mind needed for intention to be found was stated by Lord Hoffmann in OBG Ltd and another v Allan and others [2008] 1 AC 1 (\"OBG Ltd\") at [42]-[43] in the following terms:\n42 ... It is necessary for this purpose to distinguish between ends, means and consequences. If someone knowingly causes a breach of contract, it does not normally matter that it is the means by which he intends to achieve some further end or even that he would rather have been able to achieve that end without causing a breach. ...\n43 On the other hand, if the breach of contract is neither an end in itself nor a means to an end, but merely a foreseeable consequence, then in my opinion it cannot for this purpose be said to have been intended. ...\n91 Zim Integrated Shipping Services Ltd v Dafni Igal [2010] 2 SLR 426 at [19] supports the above proposition. It would be insufficient if the acts committed merely had the effect of breaching the contract. It was thus stated in Gary Chan Kok Yew and Lee Pey Woan, The Law of Torts in Singapore (Academy Publishing, 2011) at para 15.009 that the requisite intention is only satisfied if the inducer has intended the breach of contract as an end in itself, or as a means to a desired end. The authors appear to view Tribune Investment Trust as being consistent with OBG Ltd and the authorities cited in Tribune Investment Trust appear to agree with the view that the breach must have been intended. This is so even in the case where two parties enter into a contract which is incompatible with the contract that one party had with a third party: see British Motor Trade Association v Salvadori and others [1949] 1 Ch 556.\n92 Here, it is perhaps possible to argue that although the defendants knew about the terms of the Debenture or were reckless in making the various payments, they did not have any intention of inducing a breach of contract between JDD and the plaintiff. Most of the payments were to meet the ordinary expenses of the Data Centre like the utility bills or so as to get CPH on board. The latter aim was to be accomplished by ensuring that no unfavourable developments took place during the period in which the parties were awaiting completion of the Investment Agreement. However, I think this argument fails. I have held that the defendants dishonestly assisted JDD in a breach of trust. It must follow that they intended to breach the terms of the Debenture when they used the plaintiff's money to pay third parties. The breach of contract here was \"a means to an end\" in Lord Hoffmann's words and, objectively, established an intention to knowingly interfere with the plaintiff's rights.\nAre the defendants protected by \"Said v Butt\"?\n\n93 In their defence, the defendants relied on the rule in Said v Butt [1920] 3 KB 497 (\"Said v Butt\") which states that agents are not liable if it can be shown that they had acted bona fide in the circumstances and within the scope of their authority. The plaintiff's view is that the defendants cannot have acted bona fide because they disregarded the terms of the Debenture which prohibited JDD from spending the GST Refund moneys other than to repay the plaintiff. The question here is whether the Said v Butt rule applies on the facts.\n94 Said v Butt was a case of contract formation. In that case, the plaintiff had obtained a ticket for a theatre play via a friend's agency because he knew that if he applied for a ticket directly, he would be refused. His friend did not disclose that the ticket was for the plaintiff. On the day of the performance, the defendant, a director of the theatre, refused to let the plaintiff into the theatre and the plaintiff sued the defendant for procuring a breach of contract between the theatre and him. The court held, first, that no valid contract had been formed because the plaintiff's identity was material to the formation of the contract formation and it had not been disclosed. Second, if a valid contract had been formed, the defendant was not liable to the plaintiff because he had acted bona fide within the scope of his authority. The court held (at 506) that:\n... if a servant acting bona fide within the scope of his authority procures or causes the breach of a contract between his employer and a third person, he does not thereby become liable to an action of tort at the suit of the person whose contract has thereby been broken. ...\n95 Said v Butt was followed in Chong Hon Kum Ivan v Levy Maurice [2004] 4 SLR(R) 801 (\"Ivan Chong\"). Woo Bih Li J noted (at [26]) that subsequent to Said v Butt, the Supreme Court of New South Wales had endorsed the principle that a director is not liable in tort for a company's breach of contract if the director was acting within the scope of his authority. In Nagase Singapore Pte Ltd v Ching Kai Huat [2008] 1 SLR(R) 80 (\"Nagase\") at [9], I made the observation that the rule in Said v Butt was meant to \"protect persons in authority within corporate entities who genuinely and honestly endeavoured to act in the company's best interests.\" [emphasis added]. On the facts in Nagase, I held that the rule therefore did not apply to a person who wrongfully and dishonestly caused his employer to overcharge its customers. I should add that the facts in Nagase were quite different in that the defendant there was the owner and controlling mind of the company and stood to gain personally from his actions in relation to the company. Here, it is certainly arguable that, focussed as they were on achieving the continued existence of JDD through the completion of the Investment Agreement, the defendants considered that paying JDD's other liabilities was the right thing to do. After all, the plaintiff had additional security in the form of the Data Centre and CPH would have to fully discharge JDD\"s liabilities to the plaintiff on completion of the investment. The difficulty here arises from the fact that JDD was in a situation where a choice had to be made between creditors. On the one hand, it was in JDD's interest to pay various obligations to third parties, any of whom could have brought action against JDD. On the other hand, it was also in its interest to abide by the terms of the Debenture.\n96 The facts in Ng Joo Soon v Dovechem Holdings Pte Ltd and another suit [2011] 1 SLR 1155 (\"Ng Joo Soon\") address the Said v Butt rule as well. In that case, the plaintiff was removed as a director of the defendant company when he reached 70 years of age. He sought a declaration that he was wrongfully removed and an order that he be allowed to inspect certain company records. He also claimed against the other directors (who were his family members) for inducing breach of agreements between him and the defendant company. Philip Pillai J held that the fact that the persons sued were directors of the company would not, ipso facto, give rise to a separate personal cause of action of inducing breach of contract. They might have been mistaken with respect to their contractual obligations towards the plaintiff, but that would not mean that they had acted without bona fides. It would not put them beyond the Said v Butt rule (at [77]). The difference between that case and this is the presence of dishonesty here.\n97 The evidence here pointed towards the defendants doing everything they could to carry on the business of JDD normally so as to cooperate with CPH and keep it on board. They did put the interests of CPH as the potential new owner of JDD ahead of those of the plaintiff but that was because they were hopeful that CPH would pay the plaintiff off. Also, perhaps there is a distinction between defendants who act beyond their scope of authority and those who act wrongly within the scope of their authority. The facts show that the defendants here fall within the latter category as it was within their authority to approve and make payment of JDD's various debts but they did so wrongfully and in breach of JDD's obligations under the Debenture. The question is whether they can be said to have acted bona fide in the interests of JDD when they knew their actions would cause JDD to breach the Debenture. I have, somewhat reluctantly, come to the conclusion that on balance they were not acting bona fide in these circumstances. I conclude, albeit with some hesitation, that they fall outside the Said v Butt rule. They must, therefore, also be held liable for inducing a breach of contract.\nFraudulent trading\nWas the allegation of fraud sufficiently pleaded?\n\n98 The defendants object to this cause of action on the basis that the allegation of fraud was not sufficiently pleaded.\n99 Order 18, r 12(1)(a) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, r 5, 2006 Rev Ed) reads:\n12.--(1) Subject to paragraph (2), every pleading must contain the necessary particulars of any claim, defence or other matter pleaded including, without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing words --\n(a) particulars of any misrepresentation, fraud, breach of trust, wilful default or undue influence on which the party pleading relies; ...\n100 It is clear that an allegation of fraud must be distinctly alleged and proved and cannot be inferred from the facts. In Tan Boon Hock v Aero Supplies Systems Engineering Pte Ltd [1993] SGHC 237, L P Thean JA held that in an action based on the tort of deceit, there were certain essential elements that had to be specifically pleaded which had not been pleaded by the plaintiff. On that basis, he held that the claim based on fraud could not be sustained.\n101 Here, the plaintiff's pleadings were sufficiently detailed to sustain an action of fraudulent trading. In its statement of claim, it had referred to the material acts of the defendants that it intended to rely on to sustain its case based on fraudulent trading. Given that the objective of pleadings is to enable the other side to prepare his case so he can meet the case against him and to facilitate trial proceedings by limiting the issues to be tried and for which discovery is required (Singapore Civil Procedure 2015, vol 1 (G P Selvam gen ed) (Sweet & Maxwell Asia, 2015) at para 18\/12\/2), I consider that the pleadings here were adequate.\nAre the ingredients of s 340 of the Companies Act met?\n\n102 Section 340(1) of the Act reads:\n340.--(1) If, in the course of the winding up of a company or in any proceedings against a company, it appears that any business of the company has been carried on with intent to defraud creditors of the company or creditors of any other person or for any fraudulent purpose, the Court, on the application of the liquidator or any creditor or contributory of the company, may, if it thinks proper to do so, declare that any person who was knowingly a party to the carrying on of the business in that manner shall be personally responsible, without any limitation of liability, for all or any of the debts or other liabilities of the company as the Court directs. [emphasis added]\nA plain reading of the provision shows that there are two limbs that the plaintiff has to prove in order to succeed in its case of fraudulent trading. First, the plaintiff has to show that the business of the company had been carried on with the intention of defrauding the company's creditors or any other person or for any fraudulent purpose. Next, it has to show that the defendants were knowingly parties to the business being carried out in that manner.\nWas the company's business carried out with intent to defraud creditors?\n\n103 In Tang Yoke Kheng (trading as Niklex Supply Co) v Lek Benedict [2005] 3 SLR(R) 263 (\"Tang Yoke Kheng\"), the Court of Appeal held at [7] in relation to fraud that:\n... To defraud someone is to cheat him, but what is cheating? The best that one can say is that it is an act or omission in which the fraudster deceives the innocent party so as to enrich the fraudster, or cause the innocent party to suffer a loss or detriment. But the fraudster or cheat may achieve his objective in any number of ways. The only invariable element is the element of dishonesty on the part of the fraudster or cheat. Whether any given circumstances amount to fraud is a question of fact to be determined by the court ...\nWhilst the definition of fraud is somewhat open-ended, it is clear that for it to exist there must be an element of dishonesty which results in deception of an innocent party. The Court of Appeal also held that the objective standard of what an honest person would have done in the circumstances was not the sole test of dishonesty because it meant that the court had to be convinced that the negative answer in the circumstances would amount to fraud: Tang Yoke Kheng at [9].\n104 Belinda Ang Saw Ean J decided in Liquidator of Leong Seng Hin Piling Pte Ltd v Chan Ah Lek [2007] 2 SLR(R) 77 (\"Leong Seng Hin Piling\") that the subjective intention of the defendant that he had acted in good faith constituted evidence which the court evaluated and tested against the weight of the other objective facts available and, if required, the objective standard of the reasonable man. In this light, the defendants' submission that \"fraud has to be looked at subjectively\" must be rejected.\n105 The standard of proof was also established in Tang Yoke Kheng at [14] to be one on a balance of probabilities. However, the more serious the allegation, the more the plaintiff would have to do to establish his case.\n106 The defendants raised two other cases in their submissions: Welham v Director of Public Prosecutions [1961] 1 AC 103 (\"Welham\") at 123 and In Re London and Globe Finance Corporation, Limited [1903] 1 Ch 728 (\"London and Globe Finance Corporation\") at 733. However, these were not referred to in the Singapore decisions on s 340 of the Act. In any case, the two cases pertain to very different facts. Welham involved a case of forgery and London and Globe Finance Corporation involved the issue of whether leave should be given to institute criminal proceedings against the directors of a company and whether the costs of prosecution should be paid out of the company's assets. As such, they are immaterial to the outcome of this case.\n107 Here, in my judgement, the plaintiff has not proved that JDD was carrying on business with a fraudulent purpose to deceive its creditors. All the plaintiff relied on to prove its case was that the defendants expected to receive the GST Refund and that they knew JDD's assets were subject to a fixed charge in favour of the plaintiff. However, the Debenture and the other security documents, including the Refinancing Agreement, were entered into specifically to allow JDD to carry on the business of building the Data Centre and readying it for occupation while attempting to raise funds to pay off the plaintiff. While the parties envisaged that the funds would come from CPH, it was not inconceivable that if CPH could not perform another buyer could be found on completion of the Data Centre. To get a good price, it was essential that the Data Centre be completed and the plaintiff knew this. The plaintiff knew, or must have known, that JDD would continue to incur some indebtedness in the course of completing the project. The plaintiff did not object to this happening as long as, to its knowledge, its money was not used to pay such expenses. The plaintiff may have thought that JDD was paying for its expenses by other means instead of using the GST Refund moneys. In any case, it did not ask about this and was content to rest on its security documentation.\n108 As stated earlier, the more serious the allegation, the more convincing the proof must be for a finding of liability. Ang J held in Leong Seng Hin Piling at [17] that \"[t]he emphasis is on the need for convincing evidence\" and the section is not engaged in every case where an individual creditor has been defrauded in the course of the carrying on of the business of the company. The section requires carrying on business with an intent to defraud. As I mentioned above, it was the intention of all the parties including the plaintiff that the business of JDD should be carried on. No doubt the plaintiff did not expect money charged to it to be used to pay other debts but such payments were not made by the defendants with a general intention to defraud JDD's creditors. In my judgment, the plaintiff has not discharged its burden of proof here and, on this limb, the plaintiff's case under s 340(1) must fail.\nConclusion\n\n109 For the reasons given above, the plaintiff has succeeded in its claim against the defendants. I therefore order the defendants jointly and severally to pay the plaintiff the sum of $5,348,413.51 together with interest at the court rate from the date of the writ. The plaintiff is entitled to costs. I will hear the parties on the quantum of costs and on whether any orders for an account need to be made in respect of other sums that may have been paid by JDD from Monetary Claims between 28 October 2009 and the end of March 2010. I am not sure that there are such sums and hence am not making any order for an account yet.\nCopyright (c) Government of

As the lawful holder of bills of lading dated 26 January 2012 acknowledging the carriage of a cargo of 5,003.373 MT of fuel oil 380CST on board the vessel (\"bills of lading\"), \"TITAN UNITY\" (official no. 393242) (\"the vessel\"), the plaintiff commenced a claim in misdelivery of cargo by filing an admiralty in rem action against the defendants on 26 July 2012. The plaintiff claims for the sum of US$3,687,485.90 representing the invoice value of the cargo, for the direct loss arising from the defendants having delivered the cargo to third parties on 27 January 2012 without presentation of the bills of lading.\n3 The second defendant (\"Singapore Tankers\") is the registered owner of the vessel. The first defendant (\"Oceanic\") is the alleged demise charterer of the vessel by way of a demise charterparty dated 17 September 2007 (\"demise charterparty\"), the existence of which is not admitted by the plaintiff.\n4 The vessel was in the port of Singapore on or about late June 2013. The plaintiff's application for a warrant of arrest for the vessel was granted by Assistant Registrar Wong Baochen on 24 June 2013. Subsequent to the arrest of the vessel, Singapore Tankers filed an application to set aside the admiralty writ filed by the plaintiff and to release the vessel from arrest, which is the subject matter of a separate decision.\n5 The present decision relates to the application filed by Oceanic on 2 August 2013 for the admiralty action filed in the High Court against Oceanic to be stayed in favour of arbitration at the Singapore Chamber of Maritime Arbitration pursuant to section 6 of the IAA, on the ground that the plaintiff and Oceanic have agreed in writing to refer to arbitration the matters in respect of the admiralty action brought by the plaintiff. The relevant arbitration provision can be found at clause 41 of the time charterparty entered into between Oceanic and Onsys dated 1 November 2011 (\"time charterparty\") which provides as follows:\nAll and any dispute arising out of or in connection with this contract, including any question regarding its existence, validity or termination, shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration at the Singapore Chamber of Maritime Arbitration (\"SCMA\") in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the SCMA (\"SCMA Rules\") for the time being in force at the commencement of the arbitration, which rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference in this clause.\n6 Oceanic's case is that the bills of lading incorporated the time charterparty, including the arbitration provision. The bills of lading read as follows:\nShipped in apparent good order and condition by [insert name of shipper] at TUAS TERMINAL SINGAPORE onboard the Singapore steam\/motor ship\/tanker TITAN UNITY whereas Capt [insert name of Master] is Master bound for BUNKERS FOR OCEAN-GOING VESSELS (with liberty to call at any ports in any order, to sail without pilots and to tow and assist vessels in distress, and to deviate for the purpose of saving life or property) a quantity said to be:\n[Insert description of cargo]\nThe quantity measurement, weight, gauge, quality, nature, value and condition of the cargo unknown to the vessel and to the Master, which are to be delivered in the like good order and condition as the said port of BUNKERS FOR OCEAN-GOING VESSELS or so near thereto as the vessel can safely get, always afloat, unto [insert name of shipper] Assigns he or they paying freight for the same as per Governing Charter Party dated - at - all the terms and exceptions contained in which Charter are herewith incorporated, including the arbitration clause and any dispute under this Bill of Lading the holder thereof and the carrier shall be bound by the decision of arbitration in accordance with the provisions of the arbitration clause in the above mentioned Charter Party. The name and place for arbitration is available upon request from the carrier or any agents of the carrier. The amended Jason Clause and Both-to-Blame Collision Clause as adopted by the Baltic and International Maritime Conference are hereby incorporated here in and shall remain in effect even if unenforceable in the United States of America. General Average payable according to York-Antwerp Rules 1974.\nParamount Clause: this Bill of Lading shall be deemed to incorporate the Hague Rules as enacted in the British Carriage of Goods by Seas Act 1974, subject however to any other Hague Rules Legislation which in the actual case is compulsorily applicable.\n[Insert endorsement particulars]\n[emphasis added]\n7 The existence of the time charterparty, and by consequence, the existence of the arbitration agreement between Oceanic and the plaintiff as holders of the bills of lading, is not admitted by the plaintiff. The plaintiff did not contend that the purported arbitration agreement was null, void, inoperative or incapable of being performed. The plaintiff's case was that there was no arbitration agreement between the plaintiff and Oceanic at all. In other words, the existence of the arbitration agreement is in question. In the submissions made before this court, counsel for Oceanic took the position that the court's role at the stay stage is only to determine, inter alia, whether the arbitration agreement exists at the prima facie level. Counsel for the plaintiff however, invites the court to conduct a full examination of the evidence to determine conclusively if there is in fact an arbitration agreement on a balance of probabilities, before the court can grant a stay in favour of arbitration.\nMy decision\nThe applicable threshold\n\n8 The provision which confers upon the court the power to stay proceedings in favour of arbitration is found in section 6 of the IAA, which provides:\nEnforcement of international arbitration agreement\n6.--(1) Notwithstanding Article 8 of the Model Law, where any party to an arbitration agreement to which this Act applies institutes any proceedings in any court against any other party to the agreement in respect of any matter which is the subject of the agreement, any party to the agreement may, at any time after appearance and before delivering any pleading or taking any other step in the proceedings, apply to that court to stay the proceedings so far as the proceedings relate to that matter.\n(2) The court to which an application has been made in accordance with subsection (1) shall make an order, upon such terms or conditions as it may think fit, staying the proceedings so far as the proceedings relate to the matter, unless it is satisfied that the arbitration agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed.\n[emphasis added].\n9 In my view, the statutory framework in section 6 contemplates a conceptual distinction between the existence of an arbitration agreement and its validity. Analogous to the exhortation made by the existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre that \"existence precedes essence\", the existence of an arbitration agreement is a precondition to its legal validity. The questions in relation to the validity of an arbitration agreement concern the legal effect of an agreement, and whether the agreement is legally binding between the parties. When determining these questions, the existence of the agreement is presupposed, without which no issue of validity arises. This distinction is recognized in the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration (\"Model Law\"), where article 16(1), in prescribing the arbitral tribunal's power to determine its own jurisdiction, refers in the conjunctive to \"the existence or validity of the arbitration agreement\". Section 6(2) of the IAA mandates the court to examine the validity of an arbitration agreement in so far as a stay must be refused if it is satisfied that the arbitration agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed. The court's jurisdiction to grant a stay however, is not invoked, if the threshold preconditions found in section 6(1) are not satisfied. As the Court of Appeal in Tjong Very Sumito and other v Antig Investments Pte Ltd [2009] 4 SLR(R) 732 (\"Tjong Very Sumito\") held at [22], \"[i]n order to obtain a stay...the party applying for a stay must first show that he is a party to an arbitration agreement, and that the proceedings instituted involve a matter which is the subject of the [arbitration] agreement\". Reference can in the same regard be made to the English decision of Albon v Naza Motor Trading Sdn Bhd (No. 3) [2007] EWHC 327 (Ch) (\"Naza Motor\"), where Lightman J reviewed section 9 of the English Arbitration Act 1996 (the equivalent of section 6 of the IAA) which reads:\nStay of legal proceedings\n9. (1) A party to an arbitration agreement against whom legal proceedings are brought (whether by way of claim or counterclaim) in respect of a matter which under the agreement is to be referred to arbitration may (upon notice to the other parties to the proceedings) apply to the court in which the proceedings have been brought to stay the proceedings so far as they concern that matter.\n...\n(4) On an application under this section the court shall grant a stay unless satisfied that the arbitration agreement is null and void, inoperative, or incapable of being performed.\n10 Lightman J deconstructed the statutory framework for the court's jurisdiction to grant a stay found in section 9 as follows:\nAn arbitration agreement is constituted when it is brought into existence. ... To say that an arbitration agreement exists may mean that it has been brought into existence and may mean that at any relevant point in time it continues to exist. The [other term] is \"validity\". An arbitration agreement is valid if in law it is at the relevant point in time legally binding on the parties.\n...\nThe first question is what ... Naza Motors needs to establish as conditions precedent to invoking the jurisdiction conferred by section 9(1) to grant a stay of court proceedings. In my judgment the language of section 9(1) plainly establishes two threshold requirements. The first is that there has been concluded an arbitration agreement and the second is that the issue in the proceedings is a matter which under the arbitration agreement is to be referred to arbitration. The first condition is as to the conclusion and the second is as to the scope of the arbitration agreement.\n11 Section 6(1) of the IAA, which makes express reference to \"any party to an arbitration agreement\", therefore imposes two threshold pre-conditions an applicant must satisfy if the court's power to grant a stay is to be invoked. First, the existence of an arbitration agreement must be established in that the applicant must show that it is a party to an arbitration agreement with the party who instituted the court proceedings. This necessitates the applicant to show that there exists a state of affairs to support the finding of an \"arbitration agreement\", which is defined in section 2A(1) of the IAA as \"an agreement by the parties to submit to arbitration all or certain disputes which have arisen or which may arise between them in respect of a defined legal relationship, whether contractual or not\". Second, the applicant must show that the proceedings instituted in court are in respect of any matter which is the subject of the arbitration agreement. If neither one of these preconditions are satisfied, the court has no jurisdiction to grant a stay under section 6 of the IAA. When these two threshold preconditions have been satisfied, the court must grant a stay unless it is satisfied that the arbitration agreement invalid, in so far as it is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed. The second precondition in relation to the scope of the arbitration agreement is not in question in the present case. Neither is the validity of the agreement in question. The issue before this court is whether the arbitration agreement between the plaintiff and Oceanic exists. The ordinary reading of section 6 however provides no guidance as to the extent in which the court is required to enquire into the existence of an arbitration agreement. What then, would be the threshold in determining the existence of an arbitration agreement? Is it sufficient that the court finds on a summary determination that a prima facie arbitration agreement exists, or is the court mandated to conduct a full examination on the merits of the existence of an arbitration agreement?\n12 It is helpful to refer to the decision of Tjong Very Sumito, where the Court of Appeal held that it is only in the clearest of cases where the court proceedings do not fall within the subject matter of the arbitration agreement that the court would not have jurisdiction to grant a stay under section 6:\nWe noted that both Woo J in Dalian [Hualiang Enterprise Group Co Ltd v Louis Dreyfus Asia Pte Ltd [2005] 4 SLR(R) 646] and Lightman J in Nigel Peter Albon v Naza Motor Trading Sdn Bhd (No 3) [2007] EWHC 665 (Ch) (in the context of whether an arbitration agreement had been concluded) took the position that it is the court that determines whether the arbitration agreement applies; although Woo J was quick to add the important caveat that if it was at least arguable that the matter is the subject of the arbitration agreement, then a stay of proceedings should be ordered. We agree with the measured approach taken by Woo J since the question of whether a matter is the subject of an arbitration agreement is the very threshold to the application of s 6 of the IAA itself. However, it is only in the clearest of cases that the court ought to make a ruling on the inapplicability of an arbitration agreement. The court's jurisdiction to grant a stay is satisfied once the prerequisites of s 6 appear to have been met. If there is no binding arbitration agreement or if the arbitration agreement has no application, then the court has no jurisdiction to grant a stay under s 6 of the IAA, although it is of course open to the court to do so under its inherent jurisdiction.\n[emphasis added].\n13 The above exposition made by the Court of Appeal however relates to the second precondition on the scope of an arbitration agreement. Senior Counsel for both the plaintiff and Oceanic agree that there is as yet no local authority on the threshold for determining the first precondition which relates to the existence of an arbitration agreement in order to invoke the court's jurisdiction to grant a stay under section 6 of the IAA. Nevertheless, the threshold for determining the second precondition may very well apply to the determination of the existence of an arbitration agreement (the Court of Appeal did hold that \"[t]he court's jurisdiction to grant a stay is satisfied once the prerequisites of [section] 6 appear to have been met\" [emphasis added]), as this would aid in the policy of preventing dilatory tactics adopted by litigants who wish to obviate the arbitration route by placing tactical jurisdictional objections before the court. The force of this policy is however premised upon the assumption that parties have consented to arbitration, which is the question which the court granting the stay has to determine in the very first place (albeit the threshold or extent in which the court has to make this determination is not clear), and is countervailed by the equally valid policy consideration of ensuring that parties do not expend unnecessary resources in arbitration proceedings if the very foundation of that proceedings, which is consent, is lacking.\n14 The balance to be reached amongst these two competing policy considerations is dependent upon the degree of deference accorded to the doctrine of Kompetence-Kompetence, which is conferred the force of law in Singapore via section 3 of the IAA and article 16 of the Model Law. The positive conception of the doctrine, which refers to the arbitral tribunal's power to determine its own jurisdiction, is expressed in article 16(1) (see Emmauel Gaillard and Yas Banifatemi, Negative effect of Competence-Competence: the Rule of Priority in Favour of the arbitrators, in Enforcement of Arbitration Agreements and International Arbitral Awards: The New York Convention in Practice 257-258 (Gaillard and Di Pietro, eds., 2008) (\"Gaillard and Banifatemi\")). The present application before this court however requires a nuanced consideration of the extent of deference which ought to be accorded to the negative conception of the doctrine, and this relates to the absence of the court's power to determine the arbitral tribunal's jurisdiction, at least at the preliminary stage at the start of the arbitral life cycle. This exercise would in turn require a review of the Model Law's travaux preparatoires via section 4 of the IAA.\n15 Counsel for the plaintiff relied upon the writings of Gary Born, who highlighted that the drafters of the Model Law rejected in 1983 a proposal that would have expressly provided in the present article 8(1) of the Model Law for the courts to refer the proceedings to arbitration unless the court \"finds that the [arbitration] agreement is manifestly null and void\" [emphasis added], and that this rejection signifies the intent of the drafters for the courts to make a full determination on the arbitral tribunal's jurisdiction (Gary B. Born, International Commercial Arbitration (2009, Kluwer Law International), p 882, which makes reference to Report of the Working Group on International Contract Practices on the Work of its Fifth Session, UN Doc. A\/CN.9\/233, XIV UNCITRAL Y.B. 60, 67 (1983); H. Holtzmann & J. Neuhaus, A Guide to the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration: Legislative History and Commentary 303 (2013) (\"Holtzmann & Neuhaus\")). This analysis, however, relates to the validity of the arbitration agreement in the determination of whether it is null, void, inoperative or incapable of being performed, and not to the existence of the arbitration agreement. As highlighted above, the question of validity is a separate question which does not arise if no agreement is found to exist in the first place. I find more guidance in adopting a wider study of the relevant legislative history as submitted by counsel for the defendant, via the article by Frederic Bachand, Does Article 8 of the Model Law Call for Full or Prima Facie Review of the Arbitral Tribunal's Jurisdiction? (2013 Kluwer Law International BV) (\"Frederic Bachand\"). In this regard, I start with a reference to the Working Group's Fourth draft dated 29 November 1983 (A\/CN.9\/WG.II\/WP.48) (Holtzmann & Neuhaus at p500), where the drafters of the Model Law considered a draft article 17 which expressly provides a party the recourse of seeking a court's ruling on whether there exists a valid arbitration agreement:\nArticle 17. Concurrent court control\n(1)[Notwithstanding the provisions of article 16,] [a party may] at any time [request the Court specified in article 6 to decide whether or not there exists a valid arbitration agreement and], if arbitral proceedings have commenced, whether or not the arbitral tribunal has jurisdiction [with regard to the dispute referred to it].\n[emphasis added]\n16 The year after, the Working Group decided to delete the draft article 17 from the Model Law, such that no party will have the recourse of seeking a court's ruling on whether there exists a valid arbitration agreement. This is so that the arbitral tribunal can have the initial determination of its own jurisdiction (see the Fifth working group report dated 6 March 1984 (A\/CN.9\/246)) (Holtzmann & Neuhaus at p502):\n53. The text of article 17 as considered by the Working Group was as follows:\n...\n54. The Working Group decided to delete that article.\n55. It was noted that the concurrent court control provided for in that article was to a large extent in conflict with the provision in the last sentence of paragraph 3 of article 16, which precluded a party from contesting an affirmative ruling by the arbitral tribunal on its jurisdiction until the final award on the merits was made. ... The prevailing view was in favour of deleting article 17 since it might have adverse effects throughout the arbitral proceedings by opening the door to delaying tactics and obstruction and because it was not in harmony with the principle underlying article 16 that it was initially and primarily for the arbitral tribunal to decide on its competence, subject to ultimate court control.\n[emphasis added]\n17 Article 17 was placed before the Working Group a year later for consideration again, and a decision was made not to reintroduce the article on the basis that the preferred approach is found in what is essentially the present article 16 of the Model Law (See Commission Report dated 21 August 1985 (A\/40\/17) (Holtzmann & Neuhaus at p528):.\n161. The Commission, after deliberation, decided not to reintroduce previous draft article 17 but to provide for instant court control in article 16(3) along the lines of the solution adopted in article 13(3). The Commission adopted article 16(3) in the following modified form, subject to redrafting by the Drafting Group:\n\"(3) The arbitral tribunal may rule on a plea referred to in paragraph (2) of this article either as a preliminary question or in an award on the merits. If the arbitral tribunal determines in a preliminary ruling that it has jurisdiction, any party may request, within thirty days after having received notice of that ruling, the Court specified in article 6 to decide the matter, which decision shall not be subject to appeal; while such a request is pending, the arbitral tribunal may continue the arbitral proceedings.\"\n18 It is therefore evident that the intention of the drafters of the Model Law was to accord primacy to the negative conception of the doctrine of Kompetence-Kompetence, in so far as the arbitral tribunal will be given the priority ahead of the courts to decide whether there exists a valid arbitration agreement in the determination of the arbitral tribunal's own jurisdiction.\n19 Notwithstanding so, counsel for the plaintiff submitted two English decisions in support of the position that the court would have to conduct a full examination on the merits on the existence of an arbitration agreement concluded between parties before the jurisdiction to grant a stay in favour of arbitration arises. The first is a decision already referred to, in Albon, where it was held that the court must consider the evidence and make a decision on whether the arbitration agreement has been concluded between the parties before the jurisdiction to grant a stay under section 9 of the English Arbitration Act 1996 arises. The court was even open to the option of conducting a full trial to determine the issue. The second is the decision of Anglia Oils Ltd v The Owners and Demise Charterers of the Vessel Marine Champion [2002] EWHC 2407, where the court held that the question of whether the ship owner was a party to the arbitration agreement was not a question which should be decided by the arbitral tribunal, but one which must be determined by the court on the evidence placed before it before a stay may be granted.\n20 It is unclear how these two decisions may be reconciled with the House of Lords' decision in Premium Nafta Products Ltd v Fili Shipping Co. Ltd. [2007] UKHL, where it was held, with regard to the court's power to grant a stay of proceedings in favour of arbitration pursuant to section 9, that \"it is contemplated by the [Arbitration] Act that it will, in general, be right for the arbitrators to be the first tribunal to consider whether they have jurisdiction to determine the dispute\" [emphasis added]. More significantly, the two decisions submitted by counsel must be considered in light of the fact that the Model Law, which includes the doctrine of Kompetence-Kompetence, entrenched in article 16, does not have the force of law in England, unlike the position in Singapore. In addition, the procedure for a stay in England is shaped by a provision which is not found in Singapore. Rule 62.8(3) of the English Civil Procedure Rules prescribe the court's power to decide on the question of whether an arbitration agreement has been concluded, or to give directions for a trial to determine that question, before a stay in favour of arbitration is granted.\n21 It would in my view be more useful to refer to the decisions of jurisdictions which have accorded the Model Law the force of law, in order to achieve a more uniform interpretation of the relationship between article 16 of the Model Law and section 6 of the IAA consistent with international normative conceptions of Kompetence-Kompetence.\n22 The Canadian position in general adopts a prima facie determination of the existence of an arbitration agreement, as adopted in several decisions (Rio Algom Ltd v Sami Steel Co Ltd, XVIII Y.B.Comm.Arb. 166 (1993); Agrawest Investments Ltd v BMA Nederland BV [2005] PEIJ No 48; Morran v Carbone [2005] OJ No 409; ETR Concession Co v Ontario (Minister of Transportation) [2004] OJ No 4516; Cooper v Deggan [2003] BCJ No 1638). In particular, the British Columbia Court of Appeal in Gulf Canada Resources Ltd v Arochem Int'l Ltd 66 B.C.L.R.2d 113 held:\n...it is not for the court on an application for a stay of proceedings to reach any final determination as to the scope of the arbitration agreement or whether a particular party to the legal proceedings is a party to the arbitration agreement, because those are matters within the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal. Only where it is clear that the dispute is outside the terms of the arbitration agreement, or that a party is not a party to the arbitration agreement...should the court reach any final determination...Where it is arguable that the dispute falls within the terms of the arbitration agreement or where it is arguable that a party to the legal proceedings is a party to the arbitration agreement then, in my view, the stay should be granted and those matters left to be determined by the arbitral tribunal.\n[emphasis added]\n23 The position in Hong Kong is similar. Two decisions ought to be highlighted. In Pacific International Lines (Pte) Ltd v Tsinlien Metals and Minerals Co Ltd, XVIII Y.B. Comm. Arb. 180 (H.K. S.Ct. 1992) (1993), the claimant initiated arbitration proceedings pursuant to an arbitration agreement contained in a charterparty entered into between the parties through a broker. The defendant refused to participate in the proceedings, and the claimant applied to the High Court of Hong Kong for the appointment of an arbitrator. The defendant contended that no arbitration agreement existed between the parties on the ground that the broker was not given the requisite authority to enter into the charterparty. The court held:\nIf the court is satisfied that there is a 'plainly arguable' case to support the proposition and there was an arbitration agreement which complies with Article 7 of the Model Law, the Court should proceed to appoint the arbitrator in the full knowledge that the defendants will not be precluded from raising the point before the arbitrator and having the matter reconsidered by the court consequent upon that preliminary ruling.\n...\nObviously it has not been possible for me to go into this in any great detail and indeed the whole matter has been dealt with the affidavit evidence. Despite the fact that there is no document before me, which shows that World Ace were held out or authorised by the defendant to act for them in relation to its fixture, I cannot believe that such documentation does not exist. The arbitrator will have to go into this matter and sort it out but for my part I am satisfied at this stage that Article 7 of the Model Law has been complied with and that there is an arbitration agreement between these parties.\n24 The second decision is that of PCCW Global Ltd v Interactive Communications Service Ltd [2006] HKCA 434, where Beyond the Network Ltd claimed against Vectone Ltd for billing discrepancies in invoices arising from an agreement for the supply of international long distance communications services. The agreement contains a clause which submits all disputes to the exclusive jurisdiction of Hong Kong, a clause which states that the agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York, such that \"any dispute shall be submitted to the courts\" of that State, and an apparent arbitration clause which allows either party to refer any dispute to arbitration under the auspices of the American Arbitration Association. Vectone Ltd relied upon this apparent arbitration clause in its application to stay the Hong Kong court proceedings in favour of arbitration, pursuant to article 8 of the Model Law via section 34C of the Hong Kong Arbitration Ordinance (Cap. 341). Given the apparent contradiction between the three different dispute resolution clauses in the agreement, the issue before the Hong Kong Court of Appeal was whether there exists an arbitration agreement between parties. Hon Tang VP endorsed the prima facie threshold adopted by an earlier Hong Kong Court of Appeal decision in In Private Company 'Triple V' Inc v Star (Universal) Co Ltd and Anor [1995] 3 HKC 129:\nIf the judge were to go into the matter more deeply, he would in effect be usurping the function of the arbitrator. Whilst, clearly, the judge had to make a judgment as to whether there existed an underlying agreement to arbitrate, he could do no more than to form a prima facie view.\n[emphasis added]\n25 Hon Tang VP further endorsed the same approach adopted by Burrell J in Pacific Crown Engineering Ltd v Hyundai Engineering and Construction Co Ltd [2003] 3 HKC 659, where the court was concerned with the proper test to be applied in determining the question of whether it was for the court on a stay application or the arbitrator to decide whether an arbitration agreement existed:\nThe proper test is therefore is there a prima facie or plainly arguable case that the parties were bound by an arbitration clause. The onus being on the defendant to demonstrate that there is.\"\n26 I move on to consider the position adopted by the apex court of India. The decision of the Supreme Court of India in Shin-Etsu Chemical Co. Ltd v Aksh Optifibre Ltd (2005) 3 Arb LR 1 is highly instructive (\"Shin-Etsu\"). The court was not faced with the precondition issue on the existence of the arbitration agreement, but was concerned with the requisite threshold to determine the validity of the arbitration agreement under section 45 of the Indian Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 (\"IACA 1996\") (the equivalent of section 6 of the IAA), which provides:\n45. Power of judicial authority to refer parties to arbitration.\n... a judicial authority, when seized of an action in a matter in respect of which the parties have made an agreement referred to in section 44, shall, at the request of one of the parties or any person claiming through or under him, refer the parties to arbitration, unless it finds that the said agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed.\n27 The Supreme Court held that the enquiry on whether there exists a valid arbitration agreement which is not null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed is limited to a prima facie standard. It found that the absence of section 8(3) in section 45 of the IACA 1996, which is the equivalent of article 8(2) of the Model Law that expressly allows arbitration proceedings to continue and an award to be made notwithstanding an application for stay of proceedings, necessitates an inference that arbitral proceedings will not commence or continue until such time the nature of the agreement is decided upon, and that if such a decision requires a full review on the merits of the validity of the arbitration agreement, the delay caused would defeat the objective of the IACA 1996 to enable expeditious arbitration with limited court interference (see Justice R.S. Bachawat, Law of Arbitration & Conciliation (5 ed, 2010, Chapter 2). The Supreme Court took the view that there is nothing to prevent the arbitral tribunal from conducting a full determination on the validity of the arbitration agreement, which is allowed under article 16 of the Model Law, if the court takes the view of the agreement's validity on a prima facie basis. More significantly, the Supreme Court found that a full determination of the question at the stay stage would render superfluous section 48(1)(a) of the IACA 1996, which is in pari materia with article 36(1)(a)(i) of the Model Law and article V(1)(a) of the 1958 Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (\"the New York Convention\") (at [84]):\nIf a final finding were to be made upon the arbitration agreement, finding it valid and operative, such a finding might operate as res judicata. Thus one ground made available by Parliament under Section 48(1)(a) to assail the award at the post-award stage, by impugning the validity of the arbitration agreement, would be totally precluded because the finding under Section 45 on the said issue would be final.\n...\nIf the approach [of conducting a full review] ... in interpreting Section 45 were to be adopted, it could effectively make a part of the provision in Section 48(1)(a) redundant; an outcome which Parliament could surely not have intended.\n28 Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that Shin-Etsu should be re-considered in light of the more recent decision of the Supreme Court of India in Chloro Controls (I) P. Ltd. V Seven Trent Water Purification (Civil Appeal No 7134 of 2012), where there were pronouncements made which suggest that the court must make a \"final\" finding on whether the arbitration agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed. This submission can be easily dismissed on the basis that the Supreme Court decision was determined by a provision which is unique to India and which has no equivalent in Singapore: section 11(7) of the IACA 1996. The Supreme Court held (at [130]) that, \"[t]he underlying principle of finality in Section 11(7) would be applicable with equal force while dealing with the interpretation of Sections 8 and 45\". Section 11(7) confers upon the Chief Justice of India the power to make a determination in several matters in the arbitral process, and expressly prescribes that such determination shall be final.\n29 Contrary to counsel's submissions, this court is of the view that there is much force in the analysis adopted by the Supreme Court in Shin-Etsu. By parity of reasoning, the court's role at the early stage to determine on a prima facie standard whether there exists an arbitration agreement between the parties in deciding whether a stay can be granted under section 6 of the IAA, is consistent with the approach of having a full determination of that question deferred to the arbitral tribunal subject to ultimate court control at the end of the whole arbitral life cycle, with the control taking the form of either the setting aside of the award via article 34(2)(a)(i) of the Model Law or the refusal of enforcement via article V(1)(a) of the New York Convention, both of which have the force of law in Singapore, and which confer upon the court the full jurisdiction to review and determine on the merits whether there exists an arbitration agreement concluded between the parties (see, in the context of article V(1)(a) of the New York Convention, Dallah Real Estate and Tourism Holding Company v The Ministry of Religious Affairs, Government of Pakistan [2010] UKSC 46 (\"Dallah\")). This approach has the benefit of consolidating the court's review of disputes associated with international arbitration at the end of the arbitral life cycle, in so far as the court's fullest jurisdiction to determine the existence of an arbitration agreement remain with the same courts having jurisdiction to review arbitral awards (see Gaillard and Banifatemi). The desirable end result would be to prevent inconsistent decisions on the existence of the arbitration agreement and potential complications arising from arguments based on issue estoppel between the court seized of the stay application, the supervising court and the enforcing court. The experience from the well-known Dallah episode is edifying in this regard.\n30 I add here parenthetically that there appears to be some suggestion from the materials submitted that there could be a hybrid approach taken, such that a prima facie standard of review be adopted when the seat of the arbitration is in the jurisdiction of the court seized of the stay application, while a full determination on the existence of an arbitration agreement be made where the seat of arbitration is located in a foreign jurisdiction (see Frederic Bachand (at footnote 44) referring to some decisions of the Swiss courts in Trib. Fed., 16 January 1995, Bull. ASA 503 (comm. J. F. Poudret and G. Cottier); Trib. Fed., 29 April 1996, Bull. ASA 527 (comm. C. U. Mayer)). It was not submitted by counsel that this hybrid approach should be the approach in Singapore. This court is in any event not in favour of such an approach, which appears to be tainted by circularity. The seat of arbitration may not be known until arbitral proceedings have commenced, and it would not be uncommon where arbitration proceedings are not commenced until the stay of court proceedings has been granted in the first place. The approach also fails to acknowledge the fact that the seat of an arbitration may be transferred amidst arbitral proceedings.\n31 I find the position in Singapore to be even stronger than that in Shin-Etsu, given that section 10(2) of the IAA expressly confers upon the arbitral tribunal the power to rule on a plea that it has no jurisdiction at any stage of the arbitral proceedings. Where the arbitral tribunal decides as a preliminary question that it has jurisdiction, or at any stage of the arbitral proceedings that it has no jurisdiction, any party may, within 30 days after having received notice of that ruling, apply to the High Court to decide the matter. It is evident that the statutory framework of the IAA defers the decision on the arbitral tribunal's jurisdiction to the arbitral tribunal itself - not to the extent where it is the sole arbiter of its own jurisdiction, but where it is the first arbiter of its own jurisdiction, with a recourse available for parties to bring that dispute on jurisdiction, which includes the determination of the existence of an arbitration agreement, to the courts only after having had the benefit of the arbitral tribunal's ruling on that question.\n32 This is reinforced by the deeming provision found in section 2A(6) of the IAA, the only provision in the IAA which makes express reference to the \"existence of an arbitration agreement\":\n(6) Where in any arbitral or legal proceedings, a party asserts the existence of an arbitration agreement in a pleading, statement of case, or any other document in circumstances in which the assertion calls for a reply and the assertion is not denied, there shall be deemed to be an effective arbitration agreement as between the parties to the proceedings.\n(7) A reference in a contract to any document containing an arbitration clause shall constitute an arbitration agreement in writing if the reference is such as to make that clause part of the contract.\n(8) A reference in a bill of lading to a charterparty or other document containing an arbitration clause shall constitute an arbitration agreement in writing if the reference is such as to make that clause part of the bill of lading.\n33 It appears from the deeming provision that the enquiry into the existence of an arbitration agreement under section 6 is meant to be a quick and summary process instead of a long drawn examination into the facts.\nConclusion based on the above analysis\n\n34 In conclusion, there is no doubt that the court must be satisfied that an arbitration agreement exists before the jurisdiction to grant a stay pursuant to section 6 is invoked. However, it is clear from the analysis above that the court only needs to be satisfied that an arbitration agreement exists on a prima facie level for the purposes of establishing the first precondition under section 6(1). This first precondition will not be met only in the clearest and most obvious of cases. This is not to say that the court should accept prima facie evidence of an arbitration agreement when it is clearly inconsistent with undisputed documentary and contemporaneous evidence, nor should the court accept uncritically every fact placed on the affidavits in support of the stay application. Nevertheless, based on the aforementioned reasons, there is no need for the court to descend into a protracted examination of the evidence to make a finding on the merits that an arbitration agreement exists on a balance of probabilities at the stay stage. With this, I turn my attention to determine whether an arbitration agreement exists in the present case.\nOn the prima facie standard, is there an arbitration agreement?\n\n35 The face of the bill of lading makes express and clear reference not only to the incorporation of the governing charterparty, but also the arbitration agreement found within:\nThe quantity measurement, weight, gauge, quality, nature, value and condition of the cargo unknown to the vessel and to the Master, which are to be delivered in the like good order and condition as the said port of BUNKERS FOR OCEAN-GOING VESSELS or so near thereto as the vessel can safely get, always afloat, unto [insert name of shipper] Assigns he or they paying freight for the same as per Governing Charter Party dated - at - all the terms and exceptions contained in which Charter are herewith incorporated, including the arbitration clause and any dispute under this Bill of Lading the holder thereof and the carrier shall be bound by the decision of arbitration in accordance with the provisions of the arbitration clause in the above mentioned Charter Party. The name and place for arbitration is available upon request from the carrier or any agents of the carrier. The amended Jason Clause and Both-to-Blame Collision Clause as adopted by the Baltic and International Maritime Conference are hereby incorporated here in and shall remain in effect even if unenforceable in the United States of America. General Average payable according to York-Antwerp Rules 1974.\n[emphasis added].\n36 Counsel for the plaintiff took issue with the fact that the date of the charterparty was not filled in, but this does not in my view prevent the incorporation of the time charterparty. As the English Court of Appeal decision in The \"San Nicholas\" [1976] 1 Llod's Rep 8 (San Nicholas) held:\n...the question is the effect of the incorporation clause which has several blanks which have not been filled in. [Counsel] says that, as a result of those blanks, the incorporation clause is worth nothing. It is meaningless. It is not possible, he says, to incorporate a charter which is not identified in any way.\n...\nI cannot for a moment agree with that contention. It seems to be plain that the shipment was carried under and pursuant to terms of the head charter. The blanks were left because the master ... did not know its date and the parties to it so as to be able to fill them in.\n37 The English Court of Appeal endorsed the statement in Scrutton on Charterparties, (18 ed. (1974)), at p 63:\nIt not infrequently happens that, when a printed form of bill of lading provides for the incorporation of the \"charterparty dated ____\", the parties omit to fill in the blank. It is submitted that the effect is the same as if the reference were merely to \"the charterparty\" and the omission does not demonstrate an intent to negative the incorporation.\n[emphasis added]\n38 Oceanic has already given evidence by way of affidavit that the date of the time charterparty was not filled in as the issuer did not have the dates to hand at the time the bills of lading were signed (Rolf Zapffe's 1 affidavit at paragraph 42). Counsel for the plaintiff however took further issue with the fact that the blanks which were supposed to include the date of the time charterparty were filled with dashes, and that this represents the intention not to incorporate any charterparty terms. Not only was there no authority submitted in support of such a position, it is not for this court to speculate on what the intention was in the face of the evidence placed on record by Oceanic. I note that the plaintiff did not adduce any evidence to the contrary on affidavit. More significantly, this court has to give not insubstantial weight to the express reference to the charterparty and the arbitration agreement as stated on the face of the bills of lading. While the dates of the time charterparty have not been filled, this is, as shown in San Nicholas, not uncommon and is certainly not in and of itself sufficient to prevent the incorporation of the time charterparty and the arbitration agreement expressly referred to on the face of the bills of lading. A different form could have been used, or the reference to the charterparty and the arbitration agreement struck out if there was no intention to incorporate the charterparty. If the plaintiff takes issue with the veracity and the weight which ought to be accorded to the evidence adduced by Oceanic, it is for them to examine the relevant witnesses before the arbitral tribunal on the circumstances surrounding the issuance of the bills of lading.\n39 In addition, Oceanic has adduced credible and extensive evidence on the existence of the demise charterparty. This includes the exhibits of the protocol of delivery and acceptance confirming the delivery of the vessel into the demise charter, the ship management contract between Oceanic and Titan Ocean, the vessel's manager, in respect of technical and crewing management of the vessel, the employment contract between Titan Ocean and Captain Hidayat for his employment as master of the vessel, three agreements (dated 17 September 2007, 6 December 2011, and 21 June 2012) varying the terms of the demise charter, and hire invoices for the months between May 2012 to May 2013 for the vessel (see Poey Chin Yang's 1 affidavit). The same applies for the time charterparty. The time charterparty between Oceanic and Onsys exhibited in the first affidavit of Poey Chin Yang was delivered into the time charter at 1800 on 31 December 2011 as confirmed by the on-hire delivery statement (also exhibited at page 236 of the same affidavit). In addition, the tax invoices which confirm payment by Onsys to Oceanic for daily hire of US$6,700 per day up to 25 June 2012 (see Wilhelm Christian Magelssen's 1 affidavit) corresponds with the rate in the time charter, and are consistent with the continued existence of the time charter up to 25 June 2012.\n40 Taking into consideration the totality of the evidence placed before this court, I am of the view that Oceanic has established on a prima facie standard the existence of the arbitration agreement with the plaintiff.\nThe plaintiff's cross-application\n\n41 The plaintiff filed a cross-application on 13 September 2013 for this court to exercise its discretion under sections 6 and 7 of the Arbitration Act (Cap. 143) (\"AA\") to refuse Oceanic's stay application, or to order a stay in favour of arbitration subject to certain conditions, in the event where a valid arbitration agreement is found to exist. It is unclear what the plaintiff's basis is for its reliance on the AA, when neither the plaintiff nor Oceanic would like to proceed to arbitration under the AA. In any event, the arbitration agreement in question refers the dispute to be resolved by arbitration at the Singapore Chamber of Maritime Arbitration (\"SCMA\") in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the SCMA (\"SCMA Rules\"). Rule 22 of the SCMA Rules prescribes:\nUnless otherwise agreed by the parties, the juridical seat of arbitration shall be Singapore. Where the seat of arbitration is Singapore, the law of the arbitration under these Rules shall be the Act.\n42 Rule 1.2 of the SCMA Rules defines \"the Act\" as the International Arbitration Act (Cap. 143A). The AA is clearly not relevant in the present case.\n43 The second part of the plaintiff's cross-application seeks this court to impose the following two terms if Oceanic's application for a stay is granted:\n(a) that Oceanic waive any defence of time-bar, if any, under Article III rule 6 of the Hague-Visby Rules in respect of the plaintiff's claim (\"the time-bar condition\"); and\n(b) the vessel \"TITAN UNITY\" arrested, or any security provided for the release of the vessel, be retained as security in the satisfaction of any arbitral award given in respect of the plaintiff's claim made in the arbitration (\"the security condition\").\n44 At the hearing before me, counsel for Oceanic acknowledged that the security condition is a matter for the court's discretion, and did not provide any substantive arguments to persuade the court why the discretion should not be exercised in the plaintiff's favour. In view that the seat of the arbitration is in Singapore, I am of the view that it is both necessary and appropriate that the arrested vessel be retained as security in the satisfaction of any arbitral award given. The security condition is therefore allowed.\n45 With regard to the time-bar condition, the plaintiff made several arguments in relation to its alleged lack of knowledge of the existence of the demise charterparty and the time charterparty. According to the plaintiff, they knew about these two charterparties only after the time bar has apparently set in. The plaintiff relied on the two decisions, The \"Duden\" [2008] 4 SLR(R) 984 and The \"Xanadu\" [1997] 3 SLR(R) 360 in support of its position that the time-bar condition should be imposed.\n46 In my view, the two decisions submitted are not relevant in the present case. This is because even if the plaintiff knew about the charterparties before the time bar has apparently set in, the plaintiff's position is that the time bar does not apply in any event. The plaintiff takes the position that there is in fact no evidence to show that more than a year has elapsed since the cargo was completely discharged and delivered to third parties, given the mere bare assertions of delivery made in Rolf Zapffe's first affidavit. As pointed out by the plaintiff, the alleged delivery of the cargo to the vessel, CMB Pamerol, is in contradiction with the sea-web searches conducted by the plaintiff that the said vessel does not even exist in the first place. The plaintiff highlighted the complete lack of evidence to show that the balance quantity of cargo (amounting to 1,078 MT of fuel oil) has been delivered, and hence the lack of indication of when the one year time bar period had begun to run. In addition, the plaintiff pointed out that the face of the bills of lading state that the cargo was intended for delivery to \"bunkers for ocean-going vessels\", as opposed to a port. Counsel argued that by a purposive reading of section 3(2) of the Singapore Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (Cap. 33) and section 1(3) of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1971 of England, the time bar defence under Article III, rule 6 of the Hague-Visby Rules applies only to bills of lading where the intended carriage is between ports, which is not the situation in the present case. In other words, the plaintiff's position is that the time bar does not apply both in fact and in law. This is regardless of the plaintiff's knowledge of the existence of the two charterparties.\n47 If the arbitral tribunal decides as a preliminary question that it has no jurisdiction, on the premise that no arbitration agreement has been concluded between the plaintiff and Oceanic, no issue of time bar arises and the plaintiff will have the chance to seek recourse from the courts. If the arbitral tribunal decides that it has jurisdiction to determine the dispute, the plaintiff can place the very same arguments before the arbitral tribunal for its consideration on why the time bar does not apply, both in fact and in law. It is not for the courts to pick and determine what issues should be placed before the arbitral tribunal by way of imposing conditions to a stay of court proceedings, where parties have already consented to refer their dispute to arbitration, and where the relevant issues fall within the scope of the arbitration agreement. This must be so if party autonomy is respected. It is not in dispute before me, neither is it submitted by counsel for the plaintiff, that the issue on whether Oceanic is entitled to rely on the time bar falls within the scope of the arbitration agreement. A party to an arbitration agreement will not be allowed a backdoor way of obviating the limited scope of the court's review of an arbitral award allowed under our arbitral framework, by cherry picking the issues which may be placed before the arbitral tribunal via a conditional stay of court proceedings. For these reasons, the time-bar condition is not allowed. I will add here parenthetically that whether the plaintiff had in fact known about the charterparties prior to when the time-bar had apparently set in appears to be a matter which may be further examined by questioning the relevant witnesses at the arbitral proceedings.\nConclusion\n\n48 In the circumstances, the plaintiff's action against Oceanic is stayed pursuant to section 6 of the IAA in favour of arbitration at the Singapore Chamber of Maritime Arbitration, with the arrested vessel be retained as security in the satisfaction of any arbitral award given. I will hear parties on costs.\nCopyright (c) Government of

The hearing below was confined to liability only, with assessment of damages, if ordered, to proceed separately. The trial judge found that SCV had breached the NLA, but held that SingTel could not recover the damages pleaded due to an exemption clause (\"Art 8.5(a)\") in the NLA. SingTel appealed against the trial judge's interpretation of Art 8.5(a). SCV, on its part, invited this court to endorse the trial judge's interpretation of Art 8.5(a) and further relied on three alternative grounds for affirming the dismissal at first instance of SingTel's claim.\nBackground\n\n2 In June 1994, as part of the Government's plan to promote the use of information technology, SCV was designated as the vehicle through which cable television was to be rolled out in Singapore. To facilitate the speedy implementation of this project as well as to avoid the duplication of expensive resources, SingTel was to lease its extensive island-wide network of optical fibres and underground ducts (\"the Facilities\") to SCV on a long-term basis for the latter's use in transmitting cable television signals.\n3 It is not disputed that as SCV had difficulties confirming its technical requirements for cable television roll-out to commercial and landed properties, the parties decided to proceed with a lease of the Facilities in respect of high-rise residential properties first. Accordingly, Exhibit A of the NLA delineated the types of properties covered by the contract as follows:\n1.2 The building category covered under this lease agreement is only the high-rise residential apartments in public and private housing estates. High-rise residential apartment blocks are defined as having more than 3-storeys. Shop-houses in HDB estates are classified under the high-rise apartment category as well.\n1.3 The building categories which are not included in this lease agreement are single family units or landed properties, schools and other educational institutions, libraries, hospitals, government buildings, commercial buildings, hotels, URA conservation projects and any other category of buildings.\nIn this judgment, we have referred to the properties listed in cl 1.2 as \"Permitted Properties\", and those listed in cl 1.3 as \"Excluded Properties\".\n4 Negotiations on a lease of the Facilities for cable television roll-out to Excluded Properties continued after the NLA was concluded. In a letter dated 8 July 1996, Tan Kwi Yong, SCV's Vice-President (Finance), sought SingTel's confirmation that the lease charges in respect of Excluded Properties would be calculated on an \"incremental costs\" basis. In other words:\n[T]he subsequent \"commercial and landed properties\" lease would be computed based on the additional fibers and ducting requirement only. The common portion of the network already covered under the \"high-rise residential properties\" lease [\"the Common Portion\"], such as the digital ring and the fibers to the MDFs etc., shall not be charged again.\nTan Kwi Yong also requested that the preferential lease rates applicable to Permitted Properties be extended to Excluded Properties under the same terms and conditions.\n5 SingTel replied in a letter dated 17 July 1996 from its Director (Corporate Account Management), Andrew Buay. SingTel confirmed that:\n[T]he pricing for the commercial and landed properties would be based on the additional fibres and ducting, and not include the Common Portion of the network already implemented for the high-rise residential properties. However, [SingTel] would also like to point out that the previous pricing for the Common Portion was contracted on the basis of restricted use. [emphasis added]\nIn addition, Andrew Buay highlighted that the charges for SCV's lease of the Facilities in respect of Excluded Properties would be fixed at \"commercially agreed terms, and no longer based on preferential pricing treatment\".\n6 Andrew Buay wrote to Tan Kwi Yong again on 14 August 1996 with details of SingTel's revised lease charges for landed properties. Although these rates were lower than those earlier offered by SingTel, SCV felt that they were still too high and, in a letter dated 29 August 1996, referred the matter to the Telecommunication Authority of Singapore (\"TAS\") for moderation. Pending its review of the proposed charges for landed properties, TAS wrote to SCV on 27 September 1996 suggesting that it \"seriously consider\" SingTel's offer at least where commercial properties were concerned. TAS also mentioned that SCV had \"a separate option to self-provide\". We shall be discussing the effect of the various communications later (see [39] below).\n7 SCV remained dissatisfied with the terms quoted by SingTel even after they had been moderated by TAS. Following TAS's confirmation that SCV could lay its own telecommunication links, SCV informed SingTel in a letter dated 14 March 1997 that it had decided not to lease the Facilities for cable television roll-out to landed properties, but would instead either build its own infrastructure where necessary or, where such construction would not be viable, lease the Facilities from SingTel on a case-by-case basis. In reply, SingTel sent a letter dated 2 April 1997 stating:\nWe respect SCV's decision in building its own infrastructure to serve the landed property residents, and therefore withdraw all our previous offers on the lease of ducting and fibre for the same said purpose.\n8 As for commercial properties, negotiations on a lease of the Facilities continued, but again, no agreement was eventually concluded.\n9 In November 2001, SingTel discovered that SCV had been using the Facilities leased under the NLA to provide cable television services to Excluded Properties. This led to SingTel's suit against SCV for breach of the NLA. SingTel claimed that its loss and damage by reason of such breach was the \"loss in revenue that [it] would otherwise have earned from [SCV's] lease of commercial dark fibre for the transmission of the Cable Services to the Excluded Properties\".\n10 To understand how SCV conveyed cable television signals to Excluded Properties, it is necessary to first have an overview of the way in which these signals were sent to Permitted Properties. In simplified terms, cable television signals were carried from SCV's headend via the Facilities to SCV's optical receivers (\"ORs\"), which were typically housed in selected high-rise residential apartment blocks. The segment of the transmission infrastructure thus far is termed the Common Portion and is that portion of the Facilities covered by the NLA. From the ORs, the signals were transmitted by SCV's co-axial cables, which were located in SingTel's underground ducts, to SCV's lead-in pipes at individual high-rise residential apartment blocks. The signals reaching each lead-in pipe then travelled through further co-axial cables and ducts constructed and owned by SCV to the various units in each apartment block. This last segment of the transmission infrastructure - ie, the co-axial cables and ducts connecting the lead-in pipe with the individual residential units (\"the Last-Mile Network\") - was constructed and owned by SCV and lay outside the Common Portion. What SCV did was to build extensions from the Last-Mile Network. The cable television signals reaching Permitted Properties were conveyed onwards to Excluded Properties through these extensions.\n11 For ease of reference, we have used the word \"tapping\" in this judgment to describe SCV's transmission of cable television signals to Excluded Properties via its extensions from the Last-Mile Network. In this respect, we note counsel's concern that the use of this term, which carries a connotation of trespass, might prejudice SCV's case. Counsel's fears were unfounded as the key players in this dispute had themselves used the term \"tapping\" without, as far as we could see, attributing any negative connotations to it. We note that SCV itself freely spoke of \"tapping\" in its letter to SingTel dated 10 April 2002. By that time, SCV would have known that there was a possibility of litigation arising from its provision of cable television services to Excluded Properties. That SCV nonetheless referred to its own conduct as \"tapping\" indicated that it could not have been unduly concerned about any negative inferences which might be drawn against it from the use of this term. As stated, we have used this expression strictly as an abbreviated way of describing SCV's method of transmitting cable television to Excluded Properties.\nThe decision at first instance\n\n12 At the trial, SCV advanced several lines of defence. Those which are relevant to this appeal are the following.\n13 First, SCV submitted that the NLA, on its true construction, did not contain any express or implied prohibition on tapping.\n14 Second, SCV invoked the doctrine of estoppel by convention to preclude SingTel from challenging the tapping which was carried out, claiming that the parties' dealings rested on two underlying common assumptions. The first related to the charges which SCV was to pay under the envisaged lease of the Facilities in respect of Excluded Properties. SCV alleged that the parties had agreed at a meeting on 7 September 1994 to calculate these charges on an incremental costs basis (\"the Incremental Costs common understanding\"). This agreement was later reaffirmed by SingTel in its letter dated 17 July 1996 (see [5] above). The second common assumption concerned SCV's right to \"self-provide\" (\"the Self-Provide common understanding\"). It was said that SingTel had by the letter dated 2 April 1997 (see [7] above) confirmed SCV's right to \"self-provide\" - ie, to \"extend its own co-axial network from the high-rise nodes to serve landed properties\".\n15 Third, SCV argued that the damages pleaded by SingTel were irrecoverable in principle.\n16 Fourth, it was said that the pleaded damages were in any case excluded by Art 8.5(a) of the NLA.\n17 The trial judge dismissed all but the last of the above submissions. He held that tapping, although not expressly prohibited under the NLA, was not authorised. This was because \"matters outside the [NLA] were excluded from it, and had to be brought in by further agreement\". In support of this view, the trial judge pointed to para 2.4 of the draft minutes of the meeting on 7 September 1994 (\"the Draft Minutes\") which read:\nAny extension into the areas currently excluded from the Sing Tel Lease will be based on incremental costs i.e. ignoring the facilities already included in this Sing Tel Lease.\n18 The trial judge also relied on two other documents to support his ruling that tapping was not allowed under the NLA. One of these was a footnote to para 3.3 of TAS's paper on \"SingTel's Lease of Ducts\/Fibre to SCV for its Roll-out to Landed Properties\" which stated that \"the current lease term for high-rise prohibit[ed] tapping off to serve landed and commercial estates\". The other document was an internal e-mail dated 16 October 2001 from Vivien Chow, SCV's Senior Manager (Regulatory Affairs and Operations), to Thomas Ee, the company's Senior Vice-President (Broadband Engineering Services), stating, inter alia, that:\n... SingTel's NLA is for the sole purpose of serving residential properties only. As such, SCV may tap\/extend from OR[s] to serve residential properties and not commercial properties.\n19 With regard to the defence of estoppel by convention, the trial judge was not convinced that there was an agreement to charge SCV only incremental costs when it used the Facilities to transmit cable television services to Excluded Properties. He regarded the phrase \"restricted use\" in SingTel's letter dated 17 July 1996 (see [5] above) as indicative that the lease rates previously quoted by SingTel were for cable television roll-out to Permitted Properties only. Commercial rates would apply where Excluded Properties were concerned. Thus, when SCV used the Facilities to provide cable television services to such properties, it would have to make additional payment even if it utilised only those optical fibres and ducts already comprised in the Common Portion. The trial judge also noted that under the NLA, SingTel was not charging SCV purely on a cost recovery basis. When the rent payable by SCV exceeded the Minimum Guaranteed Rent set out in Exhibit F of the NLA, SingTel would receive additional payment without having to incur any additional expenditure. In the trial judge's view, this belied SCV's arguments on the incremental costs basis of charging. It was further held that even if the parties had agreed on this method of charging, it was of no avail to SCV because \"exemption from further payment [did] not operate as authority to tap\".\n20 The trial judge was likewise unconvinced by the argument that SingTel had affirmed SCV's right to \"self-provide\" and was thus estopped from challenging the latter's tapping. He held that the letter dated 2 April 1997 (see [7] above) did not represent SingTel's unequivocal consent to SCV's tapping because SingTel, in referring to SCV's construction of its \"own infrastructure\", might have meant SCV's construction of a separate transmission network independent of SingTel's existing network, as opposed to a network connected to the Facilities leased under the NLA. (SCV's extensions from the Last-Mile Network were of the latter nature.) It was further held that SCV could not in any event invoke the letter dated 2 April 1997 as the basis of an estoppel since the relevant facts had not been pleaded with the proper particulars.\n21 The trial judge thus found that SCV had breached the NLA by tapping, and that such breach had caused SingTel to lose revenue in the form of the additional charges which SCV would have had to pay for using the Facilities to transmit cable television signals to Excluded Properties. The loss of revenue pleaded by SingTel was not, however, recoverable since it was specifically excluded by Art 8.5(a) of the NLA, the text of which is reproduced in [51] below. The trial judge held that the classes of damages listed in Art 8.5(a) had to be read \"disjunctively\". Since SingTel's claim fell within the \"lost revenues, or lost profits\" part of the excluded liabilities in Art 8.5(a), no damages could be recovered for such loss.\nSCV's alternative grounds for affirming the trial judge's decision\n\n22 SCV's alternative grounds for affirming the judgment at first instance are essentially a reiteration of the defences outlined above (at [13]-[16]), namely:\n(a) tapping was not prohibited under the NLA;\n(b) SingTel was estopped by convention from challenging SCV's right to serve Excluded Properties by tapping;\n(c) the damages pleaded by SingTel were irrecoverable in principle.\nIn essence, Mr Philip Jeyaratnam SC on behalf of SCV sought to overturn the trial judge's ruling that SCV was in breach of the NLA. Since the issue of liability necessarily precedes the question of the recoverability of damages, we shall consider SCV's alternative grounds first before dealing with SingTel's appeal on the interpretation of Art 8.5(a).\n23 We propose to deal with grounds (a) and (b) together as they both come under the purview of the construction of the NLA and the extent to which the court may have regard to extrinsic facts and circumstances for this purpose. In its pleaded case and submissions on estoppel by convention, SCV sought to rely on evidence both pre-dating and post-dating the NLA.\n24 The general rule is that extrinsic evidence is not admissible for the construction of a written contract; the parties' intentions must be determined, on legal principles of construction, from the words they have used: per Lord Wilberforce in L Schuler AG v Wickman Machine Tool Sales Ltd\n[1974] AC 235\nat 261. Under the contextual approach to construction which this court has in the past adopted, the court looks at the language of the contract together with the context in which the words are used. This is because, as Lord Wilberforce pointed out in Reardon Smith Line Ltd v Yngvar Hansen-Tangen\n[1976] 1 WLR 989\nat 995-996 (approved by this court in Mt Elizabeth Hospital Ltd v Allan Ng Clinic for Women\n[1994] 3 SLR 639\nat 652, [35]):\nNo contracts are made in a vacuum: there is always a setting in which they have to be placed. The nature of what is legitimate to have regard to is usually described as \"the surrounding circumstances\" but this phrase is imprecise: it can be illustrated but hardly defined. In a commercial contract it is certainly right that the court should know the commercial purpose of the contract and this in turn presupposes knowledge of the genesis of the transaction, the background, the context the market in which the parties are operating.\n25 The general principles which underline the contextual approach to the interpretation of contracts were summarised by Lord Hoffmann in Investors Compensation Scheme Ltd v West Bromwich Building Society\n[1998] 1 WLR 896\n(\"ICS v West Bromwich\") at 912-913 as follows:\n(1) Interpretation is the ascertainment of the meaning which the document would convey to a reasonable person having all the background knowledge which would reasonably have been available to the parties in the situation in which they were at the time of the contract.\n(2) The background was famously referred to by Lord Wilberforce as the \"matrix of fact,\" but this phrase is, if anything, an understated description of what the background may include. Subject to the requirement that it should have been reasonably available to the parties and to the exception to be mentioned next, it includes absolutely anything which would have affected the way in which the language of the document would have been understood by a reasonable man.\n(3) The law excludes from the admissible background the previous negotiations of the parties and their declarations of subjective intent. They are admissible only in an action for rectification. The law makes this distinction for reasons of practical policy and, in this respect only, legal interpretation differs from the way we would interpret utterances in ordinary life. The boundaries of this exception are in some respects unclear. But this is not the occasion on which to explore them.\n(4) The meaning which a document (or any other utterance) would convey to a reasonable man is not the same thing as the meaning of its words. The meaning of words is a matter of dictionaries and grammars; the meaning of a document is what the parties using those words against the relevant background would reasonably have been understood to mean. The background may not merely enable the reasonable man to choose between the possible meaning of words which are ambiguous but even (as occasionally happens in ordinary life) to conclude that the parties must, for whatever reason, have used the wrong words or syntax ...\n(5) The \"rule\" that words should be given their \"natural and ordinary meaning\" reflects the common sense proposition that we do not easily accept that people have made linguistic mistakes, particularly in formal documents. On the other hand, if one would nevertheless conclude from the background that something must have gone wrong with the language, the law does not require judges to attribute to the parties an intention which they plainly could not have had.\nThis court endorsed the above principles in Pacific Century Regional Development Ltd v Canadian Imperial Investment Pte Ltd\n[2001] 2 SLR 443.\nWe also note that Lord Hoffmann subsequently clarified in Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA v Ali\n[2002] 1 AC 251\n(\"BCCI v Ali\") at [39] that the words \"absolutely anything\" which he used in ICS v West Bromwich referred to \"anything which a reasonable man would have regarded as relevant\".\n26 In the present appeal, two principles of contractual interpretation are particularly apposite. The first is that the law differentiates between (a) admissible background evidence of the nature and objectives of a contract and (b) inadmissible evidence of negotiations and of the parties' subjective intentions (ie, the third principle identified by Lord Hoffmann in ICS v West Bromwich). The second is that subsequent conduct cannot be taken into account as an aid to construction (see James Miller & Partners Ltd v Whitworth Street Estates (Manchester) Ltd\n[1970] AC 583\nat 603, followed in Re Lin Securities (Pte)\n[1988] SLR 340\nat 350, [37]). The subsequent conduct of the parties (including any words they use) may however be sufficient to show that they have made a new contract or to constitute the basis of an estoppel (as to which see L Schuler AG v Wickman Machine Tool Sales Ltd ([24] supra) at 261 per Lord Wilberforce and James Miller & Partners Ltd v Whitworth Street Estates (Manchester) Ltd at 603 per Lord Reid). The effect of this second principle is, as Lord Denning MR commented in Amalgamated Investment & Property Co Ltd v Texas Commerce International Bank Ltd\n[1982] QB 84\nat 120:\n[W]e have available to us - in point of practice if not in law - evidence of subsequent conduct to come to our aid. It is available - not so as to construe the contract - but to see how [the parties] themselves acted on it. Under the guise of estoppel we can prevent either party from going back on the interpretation they themselves gave to it.\n27 SCV's claim of estoppel by convention in the present case is based on the alleged existence of an agreement or a common assumption prior to (and not after) the execution of the NLA, which is quite different from evidence of subsequent conduct of the kind referred to by Lord Denning. SCV relied on the Draft Minutes and the parties' post-contractual communication to support the existence of the agreement or common assumption alleged. Is such evidence admissible to aid in the interpretation of the NLA? We are mindful, and we agree with Jonathan Parker J in Philip Collins Ltd v Davis [2000] 3 All ER 808 at 824, that the doctrine of estoppel by convention should not be used as a means to admit, as it were by the back door, evidence of the parties' alleged subjective intentions or negotiations to ascertain the meaning of contractual documents where such evidence would otherwise be inadmissible. However, a proven common assumption prior to the NLA is admissible factual background and as such forms part of the context of that document (as to which see Lord Hoffmann in BCCI v Ali at 269, [39]). In other words, a proven common assumption is an objective fact that the court can and should take into account as part of the \"factual matrix\" in which the contract was made.\n28 The minimum requirements for the doctrine of estoppel by convention to apply are, on the authority of Republic of India v India Steamship Co Ltd (No 2)\n[1998] AC 878\nat 913, that:\n(a) the parties to a transaction act on an assumed state of facts or law;\n(b) the assumption is either one which both parties share or one which is made by one party and acquiesced in by the other; and\n(c) in the case of a shared assumption, there is either an \"agreement or something very close to it\" in respect of the assumption.\nIf these requirements are satisfied, the parties are precluded from denying the truth of that assumption if it would be unjust or unconscionable to allow them (or one of them) to go back on it: see Chitty on Contracts vol 1 (Sweet & Maxwell, 29th Ed, 2004) at para 3-107.\n29 With these principles in mind, we first turn to the question of whether the doctrine of estoppel by convention applies to bar SingTel from arguing that there was a prohibition against tapping. Mr Jeyaratnam contends that as a consequence of the application of this doctrine, SCV was entitled to tap signals sent to Permitted Properties by building extensions from the Last-Mile Network to transmit such signals to Excluded Properties. In essence, SCV seeks to rely on the doctrine of estoppel by convention to preclude SingTel from asserting a different interpretation of the NLA. The meeting of 7 September 1994 is vital to SCV's case on estoppel as it would show either that (a) the parties negotiated the NLA on an antecedent agreed basis or (b) the parties accepted a particular state of things which was the foundation of the dealings between them.\n30 The alleged common assumption, as pleaded in para 18 of the Re-Amended Defence and Counterclaim, is as follows:\nFurther or alternatively, the parties shared the common assumption particularised below so that the Plaintiffs are estopped by convention from asserting that the Defendants were not entitled to:\n(1) Extend their own fibre or co-axial distribution network and\/or ducts network to serve properties not included in Clause 1.2 of Exhibit A or set out in Clause 1.3 of Exhibit A; and\/or\n(2) Transmit Cable Services to any property in Singapore utilising the Defendants' fibre or co-axial distribution network and ducts.\nPARTICULARS OF COMMON ASSUMPTION\n(a) As evidenced by the Defendants' letter dated 8 July 1996 and the Plaintiffs [sic] reply dated 17 July 1996, the understanding at the date of the Agreement was that the Defendants\n(i) could serve commercial and landed properties,\n(ii) would pay only for additional fibres and ducting leased from the Plaintiffs for this purpose, and\n(iii) would not pay any additional sum for the Leased Facilities in relation to serving such commercial and landed properties.\n31 In its Further and Better Particulars filed on 24 September 2003, SCV elaborated:\n(iii) In so far as it [the above common assumption] was oral, the understanding was reached during negotiations between the Defendants' and the Plaintiffs' respective commercial teams prior to entry into the Agreement as evidenced by the Defendants' letter dated 8 July 1996 and the Plaintiffs' reply dated 17 July 1996 which expressly agree that this was the understanding reached during negotiations. This understanding was reflected in the discussions during the negotiation meeting held on 7 September 1994 attended by Chua Sock Koong, Yvonne Kwek, Lian Bee Leng, Lim Yang Kim and Robert Tan of the Plaintiffs, Lee Theng Kiat, Kwek Buck Chye, Sio Tat Hiang, Yong Lum Sung, Tay Kiong Hong, Terry Wee, Tan Kwi Yong and Daniel Goh of the Defendants as well as Mr Goh Boon Wah from [TAS]. In addition, the Defendants rely on the discussions which took place in the meeting between TAS, the Plaintiffs, and the Defendants on 27 September 1996 referred to in the letter dated 27 September 1996 as reflecting and\/or evidencing this understanding.\n32 The Incremental Costs common understanding (as alleged by SCV) is the parties' mutual understanding that when SCV leased the Facilities for cable television roll-out to Excluded Properties, it would not be charged again for its use of the Common Portion. SCV says that the Incremental Costs common understanding was reached at the 7 September 1994 meeting. As evidence of this common understanding, SCV relies on para 2.4 of the Draft Minutes ([17] above), SCV's letter of 8 July 1996 ([4] above) and SingTel's letter dated 17 July 1996 ([5] above). As further evidence of this common understanding, SCV cites two letters which were written after 7 September 1994. The first is SCV's letter dated 13 October 1994 asking SingTel for the \"incremental rates\" for hotels, hospitals, commercial buildings, schools and public buildings. SCV claims that at the trial, Chua Sock Koong (SingTel's Chief Financial Officer) agreed that SingTel understood \"incremental rates\" to mean the costs of extending the use of the Facilities to these building categories, without any additional charge for the use of the Common Portion. The second is SingTel's letter dated 20 July 1998. SCV points out that during cross-examination, Chua Sock Koong confirmed that the rates quoted in that letter were \"based on the additional duct and fibre required for commercial properties\" and did not include duplicate charges for the Common Portion.\n33 SCV further argues that the trial judge was wrong to conclude that SingTel could, without supplying any extra optical fibres and ducts, receive additional payment when SCV used the Common Portion to transmit cable television signals to Excluded Properties. SCV's criticisms of this holding are as follows. First, the trial judge misunderstood the expression \"restricted use\" in the letter of 17 July 1996 which referred not to the types of buildings to which SCV could provide cable television services, but to the type of cable services which SCV could provide pursuant to Art 2.3(b) of the NLA. Second, the trial judge erred in regarding the lease rates for Permitted Properties as preferential rates. Third, the trial judge's finding that there was never any Incremental Costs common understanding contradicted Chua Sock Koong's evidence that this understanding was reflected in the letter of 17 July 1996.\n34 Counsel for SingTel, Mr Tan Kok Quan SC, conceded at the hearing of the appeal that SVC was right in saying that the trial judge misunderstood the words \"restricted use\" in the letter dated 17 July 1996. Nonetheless, we agree with the trial judge's conclusion that in the present case, there was no agreement or common assumption or anything close to one as to the incremental costs basis of charging. SCV has not shown on a balance of probabilities that there was such an agreement or common assumption. The portions of Chua Sock Koong's cross-examination which SCV relies on were taken out of context. The evidence is that at the meeting on 7 September 1994, the parties were focusing on Permitted Properties and thus could not have, as Mr Tan argues, come to any Incremental Costs common understanding at that time. Besides, SingTel never agreed to para 2.4 of the Draft Minutes, which SCV says reflected the Incremental Costs common understanding. We note that on 14 September 1994, SingTel wrote to SCV requesting that para 2.4 of the Draft Minutes be deleted and replaced with a differently worded version. SCV replied by fax on 19 September 1994 stating that \"further discussions\" on SingTel's proposed changes to para 2.4 were needed. It is not clear whether further discussions were in fact held. SCV witnesses gave inconsistent evidence on this issue. We do not agree with SCV that SingTel's letter of 17 July 1996 changed the situation. We accept Mr Tan's submission that this letter was written on the underlying basis that there was going to be a separate agreement for the lease of the Facilities in respect of Excluded Properties. It would be an expansive and skewed reading of the evidence to give the letter its literal effect in the absence of such an agreement.\n35 In addition, both parties' conduct after 7 September 1994 was inconsistent with the existence of the alleged Incremental Costs common understanding. It is significant that an internal memo dated 20 December 1994 to SCV's Chairman stated that the parties had not agreed on how commercial and landed properties were to be counted and charged for the purpose of cable television roll-out. This internal memo belies SCV's claim that the Incremental Costs common understanding had already been reached by then. Internal e-mails within SCV dated 26 January 1995 provide further support for our conclusion. The last sentence of one such internal e-mail stated that there was \"[n]o agreement on [l]anded and commercial building rates yet\". Again, from the meeting between TAS and SCV on 13 March 1995, it can be seen that the lease rates applicable to Excluded Properties had not been fixed yet as at that date. In fact, as late as 22 April 1996, the parties had still not settled the lease rates for Excluded Properties, and SingTel, at least, had still not agreed to the incremental costs basis of charging. This can be seen from an internal e-mail within SCV of the same date.\n36 Even if the Incremental Costs common understanding existed on 7 September 1994, it does not advance SCV's case on estoppel. At most, this common understanding shows that the parties had agreed that for the lease to be concluded in respect of Excluded Properties, the lease charges would be based on incremental costs. This does not, however, translate into a common understanding that SCV could, under the NLA, use the Facilities to provide cable television services to Excluded Properties without more; neither does it entail that SCV could use the Facilities for this purpose without entering into a separate agreement with SingTel.\n37 The Self-Provide common understanding (as alleged by SCV) is the parties' mutual understanding that SCV could extend its own co-axial network from the Last-Mile Network so as to transmit cable television signals to Excluded Properties. SCV argues that the trial judge was wrong to hold that \"self-provide\" might have meant the construction of a transmission infrastructure independent of the Facilities (see [20] above) since:\n(a) the approach for cable television roll-out island-wide was that SCV was to lease optical fibres and ducts from SingTel instead of building its own; and\n(b) SingTel's President and Chief Executive Officer, Lee Hsien Yang, had admitted during cross-examination that:\n(i) SingTel understood the letter dated 14 March 1997 to mean that SCV intended to build a transmission network connected to SingTel's infrastructure; and\n(ii) SingTel did not object to SCV's plan.\n38 As an adjunct to its arguments on the Self-Provide common understanding, SCV cites its provision of cable television services to libraries, community centres and schools under the Government's SingaporeOne initiative launched in June 1997 as evidence that SingTel knew about SCV's tapping but did not raise any objections. Although SingTel's witnesses testified that they thought SCV might have been using the Multi-point Multi-channel Distribution system (\"MMDS\") to provide cable television services under the SingaporeOne initiative, SCV contends that such evidence is unbelievable given the limitations of MMDS. With respect, we found no merit in the arguments. The evidence of SingTel's witnesses is plausible since MMDS has not been totally written off despite its limitations. Indeed, SCV was still using MMDS at the time of the trial, albeit on a limited scale. As for Lee Hsien Yang's testimony, the witness clarified that when he said SingTel knew SCV meant to use a network connected to the Facilities for cable television roll-out to Excluded Properties, his reply was based on SingTel's knowledge at the time of the trial after extensive rounds of discovery, and not based on SingTel's knowledge as at 1997. Lee Hsien Yang's evidence falls short of an admission that SingTel knew of SCV's tapping and acquiesced in it.\n39 If anything, the Self-Provide argument is a distraction just like the Incremental Costs common understanding. Looking at the letter of 27 September 1996 from TAS to SCV (see [6] above) when TAS first mentioned SCV's option to self-provide, we note that this suggestion was raised in the context of cable television roll-out to commercial properties. Prior to that, when dealing with landed properties, the letters from SingTel to SCV dated 14 August 1996 and the letter from SCV to TAS dated 29 August 1996 talked about the use of SingTel's underground pipes to install co-axial cables for landed properties. Thus, when TAS stated in its letter of 1 March 1997 that it had no objections to SCV laying \"its own telecommunications links\" for landed property, TAS must have been referring to the building of separate underground ducts by SCV. This view is borne out by SCV's letter of 14 March 1997 (see [7] above), in which SCV talked about building its own infrastructure to serve landed properties and to lease from SingTel on a case-by-case basis. Besides, the parties had very different notions of what \"self-provide\" meant. SCV understood \"self-provide\" to mean building extensions from the Last-Mile Network which would still be linked to the Facilities even though they were located outside the Common Portion. In essence, SCV equated \"self-provide\" with \"tapping\". In contrast, SingTel did not regard \"self-provide\" and \"tapping\" as being the same. From SingTel's perspective, \"self-provide\" meant that SCV would construct its own network of fibres and ducts all the way from its headend to the properties to be served without any connection or link to SingTel's network. In our view, there was no shared assumption as to what sort of self-provision SCV could resort to, which is fatal to SCV's arguments on estoppel by convention.\n40 We are thus not persuaded that in signing the NLA, SCV was acting on the assumption that it would be entitled to extend its own co-axial distribution network from the Last-Mile Network to serve Excluded Properties. At the time the NLA was signed, the parties were not concerned with the aforesaid extension, as the undisputed arrangement was to cover Excluded Properties in another agreement (see [44] below). If the question of tapping had been raised in terms, SingTel would never have agreed to it. Furthermore, if it was the case, as argued, that SCV had throughout assumed that it was entitled to self-provide by tapping, this was not an assumption which SingTel was aware of, still less one which it shared; nor, in the circumstances, can there be any question of SingTel having acquiesced in any such assumption. In our judgment, the defence of estoppel by convention fails.\n41 As an aside, the trial judge was right on the pleading point. The Self-Provide common understanding allegedly evidenced by SingTel's letter of 2 April 1997 and the SingaporeOne initiative were not raised in the pleadings.\n42 With the plea of estoppel by convention out of the way, we turn to consider the scope of the NLA and the question of whether the use of the Facilities leased under the NLA by tapping was in violation of the NLA. SingTel's pleaded case is that given the language of cll 1.2 and 1.3 of Exhibit A of the NLA (see [3] above), such use of the Facilities amounted to a breach of Art 4.3 which stipulates:\nThe Company [SCV] hereby agrees that during the term of this Agreement it shall not use the Leased Facilities in violation of:-\n(i) this Agreement ...\n43 In response, SCV argues that in the absence of an express or implied prohibition on tapping in the NLA, SCV could do what it wanted with the cable television signals after they left the Common Portion. This was because SCV's tapping did not involve any trespass, any interference with Sing Tel's property, any additional strain on the Facilities or any interference with another party's cable television signals. SCV emphasises that it used its own resources in the form of extensions from the Last-Mile Network to transmit cable television signals which had left the Common Portion to more destinations other than just Permitted Properties alone.\n44 In deciding between these competing views of the NLA, it is necessary to look at the contractual background. In this case, the relevant contractual background is that the Facilities (and by inference, the cable television signals transmitted by those Facilities) were to be used in respect of Permitted Properties only. This was at the parties' choice as SCV at the relevant time was not in a position to provide cable television services to other types of properties. Crucially, at the time the NLA was signed, a lease for Excluded Properties was mutually envisaged. This is evident from the fact that in the same month of June 1995, shortly after the NLA was signed, SCV's Chairman directed the negotiating team to proceed to negotiate the lease concerning Excluded Properties. These instructions were acted upon.\n45 Thus, it would be lacking in commercial sense or logic for there to be in existence or in tandem alongside the NLA any sort of arrangement whereby SCV was allowed to extend its own co-axial distribution network from the Facilities to Excluded Properties. To paraphrase Lord Hoffmann in ICS v West Bromwich ([25] supra), a reasonable person reading cll 1.2 and 1.3 of Exhibit A of the NLA with knowledge of the relevant background would not construe the contract as allowing SCV to extend its own co-axial distribution network from the Facilities to serve Excluded Properties. Such an extension would plainly be contrary to the parties' decision at the material time to enter into a separate lease for the Excluded Properties. Consequently, the use of the Facilities leased under the NLA beyond what was delineated by cll 1.2 and 1.3 of Exhibit A would be a clear breach of what had been agreed by the parties in the NLA, particularly Art 4.3.\n46 SCV's analogy of a carrier of goods - ie, that delivery by the carrier to a specific addressee does not of itself prohibit onward carriage by the latter to someone else - is inapt as it is based on the premise that the NLA did not restrict what SCV could do with the cable television signals after they left the Facilities leased under the NLA. Bearing in mind that SCV could only use the Facilities subject to the conditions imposed by SingTel, one of which was that the leased Facilities were to be used to transmit cable television to Permitted Properties only, any use of the Facilities beyond the limits of cl 1.2 read with cl 1.3 of Exhibit A was not permitted. We note that SCV could not have transmitted cable television signals to Excluded Properties if those signals had not been so conveyed through the Facilities leased under the NLA to the Permitted Properties to begin with. As such, in building extensions to the Last-Mile Network so as to carry cable television signals from Permitted Properties to Excluded Properties, SCV was still making use of the Facilities leased under the NLA to serve the latter category of properties. From this perspective, it does not matter that the transmission of cable television signals from Permitted Properties to Excluded Properties was through extensions built by SCV.\n47 For completeness, we should comment on SCV's argument that read in the light of Art 2.1(b) of the NLA, Exhibits A and B simply describe \"the requirements and configuration\" of the Facilities to be provided by SingTel to SCV. In other words, Exhibit A (including cll 1.2 and 1.3) deals with technical matters only (the optical fibres and ducts which SingTel is to provide) and does not prescribe what SCV can or cannot do with the Facilities leased to it. We disagree with SCV on this point. Other provisions in the Exhibit indicate that it was meant to cover supplementary non-technical issues as well. For instance, cl 2.5 sets out some of SCV's obligations under the lease (see cll 2.5.1 and 2.5.3) and also imposes some restrictions on SCV (see cl 2.5.2).\n48 The third alternative ground relied upon by SCV is that the damages pleaded by SingTel were irrecoverable in principle. It should be noted that SingTel is seeking compensatory and not restitutionary damages. Mr Jeyaratnam argues that SingTel is not entitled to damages as it has suffered no loss. SCV's tapping did not impose any additional strain on the Facilities; neither did it deprive SingTel of any opportunity to provide cable television services since SingTel was not licensed to do so. SingTel did not lose any revenue from SCV's tapping either as:\n(a) there was no evidence that SCV would have agreed to lease additional optical fibres and ducts from SingTel if the latter had sought to stop the tapping; and\n(b) SingTel would have had to incur costs by supplying additional fibres and ducts to SCV before it could earn the revenue allegedly lost.\n49 With respect, SCV's arguments miss the point. It is trite law that a right to damages arises on proof of the breach of the contract itself because a legal right has been violated. SingTel's legal right has been violated and the secondary obligation to pay damages arises. The quantum of damages which SingTel may recover for breach of contract is distinct from its right to damages for such a breach, and is to be determined at the assessment of damages stage. As for whether SingTel recovers nominal or substantial damages, much will depend on what loss SingTel, at the assessment of damages stage, is able to successfully prove. The contention in this appeal that SingTel has suffered no loss is not only misconceived but also premature given that the trial was limited to the issue of liability.\n50 A subsidiary argument of SCV is that damages are to be assessed on the basis that the contract is performed in the manner most advantageous to the party liable. This argument does not advance SCV's case for it rests on the premise that the common assumption as pleaded existed which, we have found, was not the case.\nWhether SingTel's pleaded head of loss is excluded by the terms of Article 8.5(a)\n\n51 We now turn to the appeal proper. The principal issue concerns the correct interpretation of Art 8.5(a) which reads as follows:\nNotwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement and regardless of any fault or negligence of [SCV] or [SingTel], neither Party shall be liable to the other for any indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages (including, without limitation, damages for harm to business, lost revenues, or lost profits) regardless of the form of action or whether such Party had reason to know of such damages ...\nAs stated (in [21] above), the trial judge construed the words in parenthesis in Art 8.5(a) as representing different types of damages which were to be read disjunctively. He thus concluded that SingTel's claim for damages, being characterised as loss of revenue, was caught by the express exclusion of \"lost revenues\" in Art 8.5(a). With respect, the trial judge fell into error in two separate and independent respects.\n52 First, the trial judge overlooked the importance of adopting in this case a contextual approach when interpreting a contractual term. Under the contextual approach, the scope of Art 8.5(a), which is very broadly worded, may be cut down in the light of \"the purpose of the contract and the circumstances in which the contract was made\" (per Lord Nicholls in BCCI v Ali at [26]). Article 8.5(a) should be construed in the context of the contract as a whole. The focus on the purpose of the contract and the circumstances in which it was made is particularly apt where exemption clauses are concerned. The general rule should be applied that if a party otherwise liable is to exclude or limit his liability or to rely on an exemption, he must do so in clear words; any ambiguity or lack of clarity must be resolved against that party: per Lord Hobhouse in Homburg Houtimport BV v Agrosin Private Ltd\n[2004] 1 AC 715\nat [144]. The principle that exemption clauses must be construed strictly entails, as this court held in Hong Realty (Pte) Ltd v Chua Keng Mong\n[1994] 3 SLR 819\n(\"Hong Realty\") at 825, [19], that the application of such clauses must be restricted to the particular circumstances the parties had in mind at the time they entered into the contract.\n53 In Hong Realty, the respondent's stock-in-trade, which was stored in the appellants' warehouse, was damaged by water leaking from the cut ends of an uncapped overhead water pipe. The pipe had been cut as part of the appellants' renovation works in the warehouse. The appellants' maintenance officer, having been previously informed by the workmen carrying out the renovation works that the main valve to the pipe in question had been shut, left the cut ends of the pipe uncapped over the weekend. When the warehouse was re-opened after the weekend, it was found that water had leaked from the cut ends of the pipe, thereby soaking the respondent's stock-in-trade. The Court of Appeal affirmed the trial judge's decision that the appellants, in leaving the cut ends of the pipe uncapped without putting a pail beneath to catch any dripping water while the warehouse was closed for the weekend, had breached their duty of care as bailees of the respondent's goods. The Court of Appeal accepted that before the water pipe was cut, the place where the respondent's goods were kept was a fit and proper storage place. It became unfit, however, by reason of the renovation works done. This finding was important in dealing with the exemption clauses relied on by the appellants. Karthigesu JA (delivering the judgment of the court) said at 825, [17]:\nNow, when the respondent entered into the contract of bailment with the appellants, which included exemption cll (ii) and (iii), it could not have been in the contemplation of either of them that these exemption clauses would apply in circumstances other than [those] in which the storage area in the warehouse was prior to the intervention of the works undertaken on 20 December 1986. Thus had there been a leakage of water in the overhead water supply system through some patent defect before 20 December 1986 and the respondent's goods had been damaged we have no doubt that exemption cll (ii) and (iii) would have relieved the appellants of liability. It will be remembered that exemption cl (ii) provides that the goods stored at the appellants' warehouse are stored there 'at owner's risk' and cl (iii), inter alia, exempts the appellants from the negligence or default of their servants or agents and any person acting for or under the employ of the appellants. On the other hand since the water damage to the respondent's goods occurred between 20 and 22 December 1986, a period during which the works undertaken in the storage area of the warehouse had intervened, and in the circumstances of the learned judge's finding (above referred to), with which we have concurred, thereby rendering the storage area, between 20 and 22 December 1986 unfit as a proper place for the storage of goods, exemptions cll (ii) and (iii) cannot, in our judgment, operate to relieve the appellants of liability. To give another example, if for instance owing to the negligence of Thanapal [the appellants' maintenance officer], the door to the warehouse was not securely locked and third parties entered and stole or vandalized the respondent's goods such negligence would come within exemption cll (ii) and (iii).\n54 Karthigesu JA continued at 825-826, [19]:\nIt is trite law that exemption clauses must be construed strictly and this mean[s] that their application must be restricted to the particular circumstances the parties had in mind at the time they entered into the contract. On any view of the matter the respondent and the appellants could not have intended that the exemption clauses in the contract of bailment would apply when some act had intervened to alter the circumstances in which the exemption clauses would ordinarily apply.\n55 As stated (at [44] above), the contractual structure of the NLA was expressed in terms of the Facilities leased under the NLA (and as a corollary, the signals transmitted by those Facilities) being used in respect of Permitted Properties. A separate agreement on the lease of the Facilities in relation to Excluded Properties was envisaged. In these circumstances, it would be astonishing (unless compelled to do so by the words used in the NLA) to attribute to the parties an intention to exclude a liability for tapping, a subject matter which they never thought about. By analogy with Hong Realty, the application of Art 8.5(a) (also an exclusion clause) must be restricted to the particular circumstances the parties had in mind at the time they entered into the NLA. Tapping was not under consideration at the material time and thus, Art 8.5(a) cannot be taken to exclude liability for such act or conduct. That Art 8.5(a) does not apply, extend to or embrace tapping accords with the commercial purpose and construction of this provision. The commercial purpose of Art 8.5(a) was to protect each party to the NLA against the risk of non-performance or mis-performance by the other in relation to Permitted Properties. Put another way, Art 8.5(a) was meant to apply only where the types of damages listed arose while the parties were doing what was contemplated under the NLA, ie, using the Facilities to provide cable television services to Permitted Properties. We therefore hold that SingTel is not precluded by Art 8.5(a) from claiming damages from SCV.\n56 Given our analysis of Art 8.5(a), it is not strictly necessary for us to rule on the trial judge's interpretation that this provision excluded all claims for \"harm to business\", \"lost revenues\" or \"lost profits\", whether direct or indirect. However, we should say something about the article given the lengthy arguments canvassed by the parties. This is the second point on which, with respect, we disagree with the trial judge. As a matter of construction, the true scope and effect of Art 8.5(a) is more restricted than what the trial judge, with respect, appreciated.\n57 SingTel argues that the trial judge was wrong to interpret Art 8.5(a) as excluding all claims for \"harm to business\", \"lost revenues\" or \"lost profits\". Such a ruling, SingTel argues, not only defies commercial logic, but also runs contrary to the trial judge's finding of fact that the parties envisaged a separate lease of the Facilities for cable television roll-out to Excluded Properties and that SingTel would be paid commercial rates under that lease. Besides, the trial judge's interpretation is at odds with the express wording of Art 8.5(a), especially the word \"including\" at the start of the phrase in parenthesis. In addition, SingTel's contends that its loss is outside the ambit of Art 8.5(a) which only excludes indirect and consequential loss, ie, damages that come within the second limb of Hadley v Baxendale (1854) 9 Exch 341; 156 ER 145. This is because SingTel's claim is for \"direct\" loss arising naturally from the breach.\n58 SCV, on the other hand, submits that the trial judge was right in concluding that SingTel's claim was precluded by the express exclusion of \"lost revenue\". Mr Jeyaratnam argues that in Art 8.5(a), the types of damages listed in parenthesis are not to be read subject to the words appearing before since the words \"without limitation\" allow the court to construe Art 8.5(a) as a broad exclusion. It is also said that SingTel's claim, however framed, is indirect as it does not represent the lost value of performance but is instead for loss of a potential gain which is also speculative.\n59 Direct loss is loss that flows directly, naturally and in the ordinary course of events, from the defendant's breach (the first limb of the rule in Hadley v Baxendale), while \"indirect\" or \"consequential\" loss falls within the second limb of the rule. The purpose of the first part of Art 8.5(a) is to exclude contractual claims for indirect and consequential losses or special damages; that is to say, to exclude liability in contract for losses which can only be recovered under the second limb of the rule in Hadley v Baxendale. Before we consider some of the authorities which illustrate these propositions, we find it helpful to set out the following summary from Halsbury's Laws of England vol 12(1) (Butterworths, 4th Ed, 1998 Reissue) at para 812:\n'Consequential' damage or loss usually refers to pecuniary loss consequent on physical damage, such as loss of profit sustained due to fire damage in a factory. ... When used in an exemption clause in a contract, 'consequential' refers to damage which is only recoverable under the second head in Hadley v Baxendale, and does not preclude recovery of loss of profits under the first head in that case.\n60 Saint Line Limited v Richardsons, Westgarth & Co, Limited\n[1940] 2 KB 99\nconcerned the supply of defective ship's engines. The contract in question excluded liability for \"any indirect or consequential damages or claims whatsoever\". The shipowners claimed loss of profits during the time they were deprived of the use of the ship, expenses thrown away and expert superintendents' fees. They recovered all three. In the course of his judgment, Atkinson J said at 103:\nWhat does one mean by \"direct damage\"? Direct damage is that which flows naturally from the breach without other intervening cause and independently of special circumstances, while indirect damage does not so flow. The breach certainly has brought it about, but only because of some supervening event or some special circumstances. ...\nIn my judgment, the words \"indirect or consequential\" do not exclude liability for damages which are the direct and natural result of the breaches complained of.\n61 The English Court of Appeal in Croudace Construction Ltd v Cawoods Concrete Products Ltd [1978] 2 Lloyd's Rep 55 affirmed at 62 that the word \"consequential\" does not cover any loss which directly and naturally results, in the ordinary course of events, from a breach of contract.\n62 Both cases which we have referred to affirm that \"indirect or consequential\" loss covers the second limb of the rule in Hadley & Baxendale. The English Court of Appeal in Hotel Services Limited v Hilton International Hotels (UK) Limited\n[2000] BLR 235\nexpressly rejected the criticism in McGregor on Damages (Sweet & Maxwell, 16th Ed, 1997) at paras 25-26 that such a construction of the term \"consequential\" loss was too narrow. (The author was of the view that \"consequential\" loss could in some cases fall under the first limb of Hadley v Baxendale). We note that in the latest edition of this book (Sweet & Maxwell, 17th Ed, 2003), the author has conceded at para 1-039 that a narrower construction of the term \"consequential\" loss might be justified where exclusion clauses are concerned. The author has maintained his criticism of the English courts' approach whilst recognising that the weight of authority is against his view.\n63 Equally, \"special damages\" in the third line of Art 8.5(a) should be read as being ejusdem generis with the words \"indirect\" or \"consequential\" (which are synonymous) and in effect as referring to damages within the second limb of Hadley v Baxendale. The meaning of \"special damages\" in the context of liability for breach of contract is summarised in Halsbury's Laws of England vol 12(1) ([59] supra) at para 812 as follows:\nA distinction is frequently drawn between the terms 'general' and 'special' damages, which terms have different meanings according to the context in which they are used. In the context of liability for loss (usually in contract), general damages are those which arise naturally and in the normal course of events, whereas special damages are those which do not arise naturally out of the defendant's breach and are recoverable only where they were not beyond the reasonable contemplation of the parties (for example, where the plaintiff communicated to the defendant prior to the breach the likely consequences of the breach).\n64 In Deepak Fertilisers and Petrochemicals Corporation v ICI Chemicals & Polymers Ltd (\"Deepak Fertilisers\") [1999] 1 Lloyd's Rep 387, the exclusion clause in question purported to rule out liability for \"loss of anticipated profits ... or for indirect or consequential damages\". The crucial difference between the exclusion clause in Deepak Fertilisers and Art 8.5(a) is that in the former case, loss of profits was explicitly excluded in addition to all indirect or consequential loss due to the use of the word \"or\". In this case, Art 8.5(a) refers to \"indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages (including ... lost revenues, or lost profits)\" [emphasis added]. Thus, it is only where lost revenue is indirect or consequential that it is excluded under Art 8.5(a). The decision in Pegler Limited v Wang (UK) Limited\n[2000] BLR 218\n(\"Pegler v Wang\") supports this interpretation.\n65 His Honour Judge Peter Bowsher QC in Pegler v Wang had to consider the meaning of a clause which excluded liability for \"any indirect, special or consequential loss, howsoever arising (including but not limited to loss of anticipated profits or of data) in connection with or arising out of the supply, functioning or use of [the goods and services supplied]\". The judge said at [50] that those words referred to loss under the second limb of Hadley v Baxendale. In his view:\n[T]he reference by the words in brackets to loss of anticipated profits does not mean that the exclusion effected by this clause includes all loss of profits: it is plain from the context that only loss of profits which are of the character of indirect, special or consequential loss are referred to. As was explained in Victoria Laundry (Windsor) Ltd v Newman Industries Ltd\n[1949] 2 KB 528\nat 536, claims for loss of profits may fall into either the first or the second rule in Hadley v Baxendale, depending on the circumstances. [emphasis in original]\n66 As for \"incidental\" damages, we note the English Court of Appeal's decision in Leicester Circuits Limited v Coates Brothers Plc [2003] EWCA Civ 290. In that case, the phrase in question excluded liability for \"consequential or incidental damage of any kind whatsoever ... including without limitation any indirect loss or damage such as operating loss, loss of clientele\". The appellate court held at [63] that:\nThe loss of clientele has to be of a kind which is truly \"consequential\" before it can be excluded. The words \"or incidental\" are too vague to detract from the requirement that the word \"consequential\"is to be understood in the sense adopted by this court in Croudace Construction Ltd v Cawoods Concrete Products Ltd [1978] 2 Lloyds Rep.55, 8 BLR 20.\n67 Likewise, we are of the view that the word \"incidental\" in Art 8.5(a) is superfluous. The phrases in parenthesis - \"harm to business\", \"lost revenues\" or \"lost profits\" - are examples of indirect or consequential loss or special damages, all of which are recognised as claims falling under the second limb of the rule in Hadley v Baxendale. It is \"lost revenues\" that are indirect or consequential which are excluded under Art 8.5(a).\n68 The concluding words of the first part of Art 8.5(a) (\"whether such Party had reason to know of such damages\") is further support that its purpose is to exclude contractual claims for indirect and consequential losses or special damages. Those words appear to have been added out of caution given the strict approach of the courts to exclusion clauses, rather than as a palpable attempt to exclude damages under the first limb of the rule in Hadley v Baxendale.\n69 By way of observation, at the end of the day, the opposing views as to the meaning of Art 8.5 (a) rest on whether the loss is direct or indirect. Assuming for the sake of discussion that Art 8.5(a) applies (we have concluded that it does not in [55] above), a factual analysis of the loss would have been required in order to assess how \"direct\" or \"indirect\" the loss was, and this could not be achieved until assessment of damages when the evidence is before the court. As a split trial was ordered, it is not surprising to find that the affidavits of evidence-in-chief focused primarily on issues of liability.\n70 In conclusion, for the reasons given, we allow this appeal with costs.

They had three children of the marriage, of which the eldest is \"Child A\", born in December 2000. The other two children were born in 2005 and 2007 respectively. During the ancillary matters hearing on 27 September 2013, the district judge made orders regarding custody, maintenance of the children and division of assets. I set out below the relevant portions of that order:\n(a) the parties shall have joint custody of the 3 children of the marriage, with care and control to the appellant;\n(b) the respondent be allowed reasonable access to the 3 children of the marriage as follows:\n(i) Wednesdays from 7pm to 9pm;\n(ii) overnight access from Friday 7pm to Saturday 9pm; and\n(iii) half of the children's school holidays in June and December each year, subject to the children's schedules;\n(c) the respondent be allowed access to Child A every Monday from 7pm to 9pm, subject to her tuition and school schedules;\n(d) the respondent, within 6 months of the date of extraction of the final judgment, is to transfer all his rights, title and interest in the matrimonial home to the appellant, upon the appellant paying a consideration equivalent to 25% of the net value of the matrimonial home (and if not transferred within 6 months, for the home to be sold within the next 6 months, with the net sale proceeds to be divided in the proportion of 75% to the appellant and 25% to the respondent);\n(e) the respondent is to pay the appellant a sum of $1 in spousal maintenance, with effect from 27 September 2013; and\n(f) the respondent is to pay the appellant a sum of $350 for the maintenance of each child (total sum of $1,050), with effect from 27 September 2013.\n3 Before this court, the appellant argued that:\n(a) the order allowing the respondent access to Child A every Monday from 7pm to 9pm should be revoked, as it is disruptive to her studies;\n(b) the order of maintenance for each child should be increased from $350 per month to $500 per month (total sum of $1,500); and\n(c) the order pertaining to the disposal of the matrimonial home should be amended, such that rather than the appellant having to pay the respondent consideration equivalent to 25% of the net value of the matrimonial home, the appellant should only have to refund to the respondent's Central Provident Fund (\"CPF\") account the amount that he had utilised for the purchase of the property, inclusive of accrued interest.\nI will deal with each of these in turn.\n4 First, the appellant argued that allowing the respondent access to Child A every Monday from 7pm to 9pm would be disruptive, as Child A usually has tuition classes on Mondays from 7pm to 8.30pm, or from 5pm to 6.30pm, depending on her school schedule and availability of her private tutor. In response, counsel for the respondent highlighted that the order for Monday access to Child A was indeed subject to tuition and school schedules, and pointed out that the Saturday access that was granted to the respondent was frequently denied because the appellant's mother would take the children out after their tuition classes on Saturday afternoon. It is not easy to determine who was right (if there could be a right party) in this situation. For the reasons that follow, it was not necessary for me to make a specific finding on this issue but the parties must appreciate what the nature of an access order is. Ultimately, the court has to decide based on the best interests and wellbeing of the children in making such orders and would do so by getting both parents involved in the upbringing of the children. It is important that the child continues to interact with both parents more so than issues of tuition schedules. I thus dismiss the appellant's appeal on the access order, and leave it to the parties to sort out the scheduling issues themselves, but with liberty to apply.\n5 Second, the appellant sought more \"child maintenance\" from the respondent. The appellant is earning about $19,500 net per month. The respondent is earning about $3,000 per month. The appellant is 12 years younger than the respondent. Before the district judge, the appellant sought $800 in maintenance per month per child, from the respondent. Her counsel later adjusted this figure down to $500. The appellant argued that the expenses of the three children totalled $11,460 each month. The district judge deemed this an exorbitant figure, preferring a figure of $4,366 instead for all three children each month, based on his calculations. The district judge ordered the respondent to contribute $1,050 in maintenance - in total - to the three children, as he assessed this to have been about 25% of the expenses of the children. Before this court, the appellant did not argue that the respondent should have to bear more than 25% of the children's expenses. Rather, she disagreed with the district judge's discounting of certain items of expenses. For instance, the district judge found that expenses for Child A's tuition classes was not $1,800 per month, as argued by the appellant, but rather $800. Before me, the appellant argued that the district judge was wrong. Further, she argued, since Child A is now in Secondary School, her classes would cost even more - about $2,000 per month. In sum, she argued that the district judge had failed to take into account \"the financial needs of the children and the standard of living enjoyed by the children\". These are indeed relevant factors to take into account, but I do not see any ostensible errors in the district judge's account of the appellant's alleged figure. The appellant did not seem to dispute that the respondent was earning $3,000 per month, or that there was indeed a significant disparity between their incomes. Given this disparity, I dismiss the appellant's appeal on maintenance for the children.\n6 Third, the appellant argued that she should not have to pay the respondent 25% of the value of the matrimonial home - rather, she should only have to refund the appellant's CPF contribution plus interest. In monetary terms, this is a difference of between $130,126.50 and $2,188.07. The district judge arrived at the (former) figure upon having calculated that the total assets of both parties should have been split with 17% going to the respondent and the remainder to the appellant. To facilitate the practical dividing of assets (and because having the respondent transfer his share to the appellant was the option proposed by the appellant in her first affidavit of assets and means), the district judge equated the respondent's 17% share of the total assets to 25% of the matrimonial flat upon division, and hence made the order that the appellant simply pay the respondent consideration amounting to this 25%, thereby disposing of the entire matter of division of assets. This is depicted below:\nNo\nDescription\nAmount\nCalculation\/Comment\n1\nRespondent's share of total pool of assets\n17%\nDistrict judge's finding, based on parties' contributions\n2\nTotal pool of assets (net)\n$975,867\nBased on parties' declared figures\n3\nRespondent's share of pool of assets\n$165,897.40\nFig 2 ($975,867) x Fig 1(17%), rounded up to 1 decimal place\n4\nRespondent's existing assets (net) in his name\n$30,891.60\nBased on parties' declared figures\n5\nAmount of assets to be transferred to Respondent\n$135,005.80\nFig 3 ($165,897.40) - Fig 4 ($30,891.60)\n6\nNet Value of the matrimonial flat\n$526,609.70\nBased on parties' declared valuation ($800,000) - current outstanding loan ($273,390.29), rounded to 1 decimal place\n7\nAppellant's percentage share in matrimonial flat\n25.6%\nFig 5 ($135,005.80) \/ Fig 6 ($526,609.70) x 100%, rounded to 1 decimal place\n7 The district judge arrived at Figure 1 - the respondent's share of 17% of the total amount of assets - by attributing to the respondent 5.8% in direct contributions to the total pool of assets and 11.2% in indirect (and other) contributions to the marriage. Before this court, the appellant's main dispute was with the district judge's finding as to the respondent's indirect contributions. The district judge arrived at the figure of 11.2% based on his findings that the respondent had contributed in the following ways:\n(a) payment of the full amount of the home protection scheme, totalling $8,704.98;\n(b) payments of property tax;\n(c) taking care of children as house husband - and primary caregiver - with the assistance of the domestic helper, from 2005 to 2012; and\n(d) taking care of the appellant during the appellant's maternity confinement periods for the 2 and 3 children.\n8 The appellant argued before me that the 11.2% figure was too high as the district judge failed to appreciate that \"there was a full time maid throughout the duration of the marriage\". I disagree, as the district judge had clearly articulated his awareness of the assistance the respondent received from the domestic helper in his grounds of decision (at [27]). The appellant also disputed the extent of the respondent's role as a house husband, arguing that he \"did not do anything at home\", and \"slept until midday every day and was lazing and bumming around the matrimonial home\". It is not necessary to refer to all the evidence put forward by the parties (for example, a birthday card given by Child A to the respondent which evinces his taking care of her when she was sick, and a text message from the appellant to the respondent, sent on 30 March 2011, in which she mentioned \"[appreciate] you taking the role of a father though our marriage is not working out\") to substantiate - or discredit - the extent of the respondent's involvement in the home. There was sufficient evidence to persuade the court below that the respondent did indeed make indirect contributions to the family by taking care of the children and enabling the appellant to excel in her career. I hence dismiss the appellant's appeal on the division of assets (and specifically, the matrimonial home).\n9 In conclusion, the appellant's appeal is dismissed. It seemed to me that much of the appellant's case before me arose from a misunderstanding of the district judge's grounds of decision. Also, especially with regard to the dispute over custody, the parties must remember to put the interests of their children before all else. Notwithstanding the importance of education, I reiterate that personal interaction between child and parent can be more crucial than tuition classes in the development of the child. The parties must attempt to reach a sensible balance between the two, failing which, there will be liberty to apply to court.\nCopyright (c) Government of Singapore.\n","label":[[42,63,"CASE_NUMBER"],[171,181,"COURT"],[190,205,"JUDGE"],[224,255,"LAWYER"],[257,275,"ORG"],[296,316,"LAWYER"],[318,343,"ORG"],[419,432,"JUDGE"],[525,542,"DATE"],[707,722,"GPE"],[753,764,"DATE"],[796,806,"DATE"],[850,862,"DATE"],[896,908,"DATE"],[993,1006,"DATE"],[1112,1129,"DATE"],[10275,10288,"DATE"],[11460,11483,"ORG"]],"Comments":[]}

For ease of explication, I will first provide a broad overview of the parties. These applications concern USP Group Limited (\"USP Group\"). On 26 October 2022, Hinterland Energy Pte Ltd, Harmonic Brothers Pte Ltd, Hia Yi Heng, and Lim Shi Wei (\"the Requisitionists\") signed off on a letter that, among others, purports to be a requisition notice (\"the Requisition Notice\") under s 176(1) of the Companies Act 1967 (2020 Rev Ed) (\"the Companies Act\") for USP Group to convene an extraordinary general meeting (\"EGM\"). The purpose of the EGM was to remove USP Group's existing directors and to appoint new directors in their stead. The existing directors include Mr Tanoto Sau Ian (\"Tanoto\"), who is the current Chief Executive Officer and Executive Director of USP Group.\n2 As a preliminary point, the two applications were originally fixed to be heard together. However, the Requisitionists did not realise this and asked that the hearing for HC\/OA 156\/2023 (\"OA 156\") be rescheduled so that they can file their submissions in time. I acceded to the Requisitionists' request. I therefore heard HC\/OA 218\/2023 (\"OA 218\") on 14 April 2023 and then OA 156 on 17 April 2023, which was the following Monday. As the EGM that is the subject matter of the applications is scheduled to be held on 21 April 2023, I reserved my decision for a short time to consider the parties' arguments carefully.\n3 In OA 218 that I heard earlier, USP Group seeks a primary declaration that the Requisitionists are not \"members\" of USP Group for the purposes of s 176(1) of the Companies Act. Consequently, USP Group seeks a secondary declaration that the Requisition Notice is invalid for the purposes of s 176(1) of the Companies Act (\"s 176(1)\"). The second application is OA 156, in which Tanoto primarily seeks permission pursuant to s 216A(2) of the Companies Act (\"s 216A(2)\") to bring an action in the name and on behalf of USP Group against the Requisitionists for an injunction to prevent them from requisitioning an EGM under s 176(1). In the meantime, until this primary prayer is resolved substantively, Tanoto also seeks an interim injunction against the Requisitionists to prevent them from holding the EGM pursuant to the Requisition Notice. The Requisitionists are interveners in OA 156 and object to the application. USP Group, as the defendant in OA 156, takes no position as to the application.\n4 As I observed to the parties during the hearings, it makes sense for me to consider OA 218 before OA 156. This is because if I were to decide that the Requisitionists do not have standing under s 176(1) to requisition an EGM, then there would no EGM to injunct against. Of course, I recognise that Tanoto's primary prayer in OA 156 is for permission to bring an action in the name and on behalf of USP Group under s 216A for an injunction to restrain the Requisitionists from ever requisitioning an EGM. Before me, Ms Cathryn Neo (\"Ms Neo\"), who appeared for Tanoto, clarified that the prayer is actually for an injunction until certain investigations are over. I will say more about this primary prayer later.\n5 For reasons that I will now explain, I make the declarations sought by USP Group in OA 218. I find that the Requisitionists do not have standing to requisition the EGM pursuant to s 176(1), such that the Requisition Notice is invalid. In the premises, I make no order in relation to Tanoto's secondary prayer in OA 156 for an interim injunction against the EGM because there is now no more EGM to injunct against. However, I dismiss Tanoto's primary prayer in OA 156. I do not grant permission for Tanoto to bring an action on behalf of USP Group to restrain the Requisitionists from ever requisitioning an EGM. In my view, it is not appropriate to restrain a future event that may or may not happen, and Tanoto has not shown any good reason why the Requisitionists should be denied the right to requisition an EGM in the future. In so far as Ms Neo sought to constrain this primary prayer, I reject that contention as it does not fit with the wording of the prayer in OA 156 and any amendment has come too late in the day.\nBackground facts\n\n6 I start with a brief elaboration of the background facts. To begin, USP Group is a public company limited by shares. It is listed on the main board of the Singapore Stock Exchange since 2007. At present, it has issued and paid-up share capital of over $67m, comprising 90,922,003 shares, of which 634,600 are treasury shares.\nThe Requisition Notice sent by the Requisitionists\n\n7 On 26 October 2022, the Requisition Notice was sent to USP Group. The Requisition Notice called for the passing of nine ordinary resolutions which pertained to the removal of the existing Board of Directors, and for the appointment of a new Board of Directors. The Requisition Notice provided several reasons to explain these resolutions, two of which being that the current Board of Directors lacks shareholder support and that there is a need for the renewal of leadership. For present purposes, there is no need to go into these reasons any further.\n8 At the time of the Requisition Notice, the Requisitionists were the beneficial owners of a total of 9,942,220 ordinary shares. This represented approximately 11.01% of the total issued and paid-up ordinary shares (excluding treasury shares) of USP Group. Crucially, however, none of the Requisitionists' names appear on USP Group's Register of Members on 26 October 2022. Instead, in the Requisition Notice, each of the Requisitionists signed off in their own capacities, on behalf of various brokerage houses. The names of these brokerage houses appear on USP Group's Register of Members.\n9 On 27 October 2022, USP Group released a general announcement to say that it had received the Requisition Notice. The general announcement further stated that USP Group was seeking legal advice on the contents of the Requisition Notice and that shareholders would be updated in due course. By way of follow-up to the Requisition Notice, USP Group sent a letter to the Requisitionists on 3 November 2022. By that letter, USP Group asked the Requisitionists to provide copies of the authority letters referred to in the Requisition Notice as evidence that the Requisitionists remained the beneficial owners of their respective shareholdings in USP Group as at the date of the Requisition Notice.\n10 On 11 November 2022, the Requisitionists sent USP Group a letter enclosing the authority letters which showed the Requisitionists' shareholdings. On 14 November 2022, USP Group sent the Requisitionists a letter to say that USP Group was \"carefully considering\" the Requisition Notice and the authority letters that had been provided to them. On 22 November 2022, USP Group sent the Requisitionists an email to say that USP Group's Board of Directors had \"carefully considered\" the Requisition Notice and resolved not to convene the EGM. Further to this email, USP Group on 24 November 2022 released an announcement stating that it will not be convening an EGM.\nFurther correspondence between the parties in relation to the Requisition Notice\n\n11 Between 30 November 2022 and 29 December 2022, USP Group and the Requisitionists continued to correspond in relation to the Requisition Notice. Specifically, by a letter dated 30 November 2022, the Requisitionists informed USP Group that they disagreed with USP Group's announcement on 24 November 2022 that it would not be convening the EGM. The Requisitionists asked USP Group to immediately convene the EGM within two months from the receipt of the Requisition Notice, pursuant to s 176(1). The Requisitionists also stated that if USP Group did not convene the EGM within seven days, then they would proceed to convene the EGM to consider the various resolutions raised. When USP Group did not reply by 9 December 2022, the Requisitionists sent USP Group a letter on 9 December 2022, in which the Requisitionists stated that they would \"proceed to exercise their rights pursuant to Section 176(3) of the [Companies] Act and recover all reasonable expenses incurred by the [Requisitionists] from current directors of [USP Group] pursuant to Section 176(4) of the [Companies] Act\".\n12 When USP Group did not reply to this letter, the Requisitionists sent yet another letter to USP Group on 16 December 2022. In this letter, the Requisitionists stated that they would proceed to exercise their rights pursuant to s 176(3) of the Companies Act and recover all reasonable expenses incurred by them from the current directors of USP Group pursuant to s 176(4) of the same Act. On 19 December 2022, USP Group finally responded by way of an email stating that USP Group would take reasonable steps to cooperate with the Requisitionists when the Requisitionists convened the EGM. The email also indicated that USP Group would like to be involved in the review of the appointments and\/or scope of engagement of any third-party service providers as well as any documents relating to the EGM. The Requisitionists replied by letter on the same day to state, among other things, that they would proceed to conduct the EGM and that, to that end, they had appointed Toppan Merrill Pte Ltd to print and dispatch the EGM documents to the shareholders. In particular, the Requisitionists requested for a copy of the register and index of members in the following formats: (a) as of 23 December 2022 for their inspection pursuant to s 192(2) of the Companies Act, which was for the purpose of dispatching the Notice of EGM, Shareholders' Circular, and related documents; and (b) as of 11am on 18 January 2023, being 72 hours before the scheduled EGM.\n13 On 22 December 2022, the Requisitionists sent USP Group an email stating that the proposed EGM was scheduled for 20 January 2023. The email also provided further information relating to ancillary matters for the conduct of the EGM. The parties exchanged several emails later that day in relation to the Requisitionists' request for USP Group to instruct its Share Registrar to release the Register of Members and to assist with the various ancillary matters set out in the Requisitionists' letter of 19 December 2022. In the end, the Requisitionists concluded that USP Group had clearly shown an intention not to cooperate with the Requisitionists. In particular, based on the time for the inspection on 23 December 2022, and for the Share Registrar to meet the Requisitionists' requests, USP Group would have to give instructions to the Share Registrar before the close of business hours on 22 December 2022. Since USP Group had failed to do that, the Share Registrar was not in a position to provide the Register of Members to the Requisitionists by 23 December 2022. On 23 December 2022, USP Group responded to deny that it did not intend to cooperate with the Requisitionists. It also attached its email instructing the Share Registrar to provide the Requisitionists with the relevant information as of 23 December 2022.\n14 USP Group finally provided the relevant information to the Requisitionists on 27 December 2022. However, the Requisitionists say that it was already impossible for the EGM to be conducted by the intended deadline of 26 January 2023. Given what the Requisitionists perceived to be USP Group's lack of cooperation in assisting them in convening the EGM, the Requisitionists appointed Jacque Law LLC (\"Jacque Law\") to enforce their rights against USP Group. Jacque Law sent an email to USP Group on the same day to state, among other things, that the Requisitionists intended to apply to court by 29 December 2022 to seek an extension of the validity of the Requisition Notice by a period of eight weeks from the date the court makes the order.\nApplications in relation to the Requisition Notice\n\n15 When USP Group did not reply to Jacque Law's email sent on 27 December 2022, the Requisitionists filed HC\/OA 894\/2022 (\"OA 894\") on 29 December 2022 to seek an extension of the validity of the Requisition Notice. OA 894 concluded with a court order on 13 February 2023 which extended the validity of the Requisition Notice by a period of eight weeks (\"the OA 894 Order\"). The OA 894 Order also directed USP Group to provide other assistance to enable the Requisitionists to convene the EGM. To this end, the Requisitionists wrote to USP Group on 17 February 2023 to take steps to convene the EGM.\n16 However, due to what the Requisitionists have characterised as \"a barrage of excuses\" from USP Group, the Requisitionists could not hold the EGM by the deadline pursuant to the OA 894 Order, ie, 10 April 2023. The Requisitionists then filed HC\/SUM 676\/2023 (\"SUM 676\") on 9 March 2023. The Requisitionists had asked for a further extension of time of three weeks from 10 April 2023 to 1 May 2023 to hold the EGM pursuant to the Requisition Notice. A day after the Requisitionists filed SUM 676, USP Group filed OA 218. On 20 March 2023, the High Court heard SUM 676 and granted the extension of time sought by the Requisitionists.\n17 It is against this background that the present applications have come before me.\nOA 218\nThe parties' positions\n\n18 I turn first to OA 218. USP Group's position here is that after the OA 894 Order was made, it discovered that the Requisitionists may not be entitled to invoke s 176(1), even as it appears that the Requisitionists have a beneficial interest in USP Group's shares. USP Group says that the Requisitionists hold their shares through nominees which are, namely, CGS-CIMB, KGI Securities and Phillip Securities. As such, USP Group argues that the Requisitionists may not be \"members\" under s 176(1) because their names do not appear on the Register of Members.\n19 USP Group admits that this issue was discovered only after OA 894 was heard. However, it maintains that the Requisitionists have not suffered any prejudice because this was a simple issue that the Requisitionists can easily rectify by transferring the shares from their nominees to their respective own names. Moreover, because USP Group has more than 1,900 shareholders, the consequences and risk of acting on an invalid Requisition Notice are simply too great for it to bear. This is why, despite the lateness in filing OA 218, USP Group has still decided to proceed with this application.\n20 The Requisitionists make essentially three arguments in response to USP Group's challenge against their standing as members to make the requisition under s 176(1).\n21 First, the Requisitionists argue that USP Group's conduct since receiving the Requisition Notice on 26 October 2022 estops it from claiming that the Requisitionists are not members of USP Group, or that the Requisition Notice is invalid. The Requisitionists argue for two types of estoppel, namely, estoppel by convention, and estoppel arising by judicial record. In this regard, the Requisitionists point out that USP Group knew that the Requisitionists were not members, and despite knowing that, had effectively acquiesced, represented to, and induced the Requisitionists to believe that USP Group had no objections to the validity of the Requisition Notice, or the Requisitionists' standing under s 176(1). Further, the Requisitionists point out that order 6 of the OA 894 Order was granted pursuant to s 176(4) of the Companies Act. This thereby confirmed that OA 894 had proceeded on the basis that the Requisitionists were members of USP Group and that the Requisition Notice was valid pursuant to s 176(1). For completeness, the said order 6 provides as follows:\nUSP Group shall pay to the Claimants all reasonable expenses incurred in convening the EGM for USP Group (excluding any expenses incurred but which was aborted in relation to the previous EGM that the Claimants had attempted to convene), arising from the failure of the USP Group's Board of Directors to convene the said EGM.\n22 Second, the Requisitionists argue that OA 218 was filed to mount a collateral attack on order 6 of the OA 894 Order and that this is not permissible under the extended doctrine of res judicata. In particular, the Requisitionists argue that USP Group could and should have raised the issue of the Requisitionists' standing as members in OA 894. Given that USP Group has not provided any reason for not having done so, it is clear that USP Group is abusing the process of the court through OA 218.\n23 Third, and more broadly, the Requisitionists say that USP Group and its current Board of Directors are trying all ways and means to stymie the holding of the EGM. As such, the Requisitionists will suffer prejudice if they are asked to procure the transfer of the shares to themselves now. Contrary to USP Group's assertions, the Requisitionists say that this transfer will take more than a few days. This is because the first and second Requisitionists (Hinterland Energy Pte Ltd and Harmonic Brothers Pte Ltd) do not have any existing account in their names in which they can hold the shares. The opening of the requisite account could take more than two months. Moreover, Hinterland Energy Pte Ltd does not have USP Group's latest audited financial statements to support such an application to the Central Depository (Pte) Ltd (\"CDP\"). It is therefore unfair for USP Group to have allowed the Requisitionists to labour under the impression for months that USP Group would not object to their standing as members or the validity of the Requisition Notice.\nMy decision: the Requisitionists are not \"members\" for the purposes of s 176(1) of the Companies Act\n\n24 Having considered the parties' submissions, I am compelled to conclude that the Requisitionists are not \"members\" for the purposes of s 176(1). I say that I am so \"compelled\" because I would have preferred to allow the democratic processes of USP Group to take its course (see the Hong Kong High Court decision of China Investment Fund Company Ltd v Guang Sheng Investment Group Ltd and others [2016] HKCU 1395 at [24]; see also the Malaysian High Court decision of Dato' Seri Mak Hon Leong & Anor v NWP Holdings Bhd [2022] 8 MLJ 731 (\"NWP Holdings\") at [11]). More broadly, I would also have preferred not to intervene to prevent shareholders or members from having a voice in the affairs of a company except where absolutely necessary. Unfortunately, despite these sentiments, and the lateness in which USP Group has raised the issues it has in OA 218, I am compelled by the law to say that the Requisitionists are not \"members\" for the purposes of s 176(1).\nThe Requisitionists are plainly not \"members\" as their names do not appear on the Register of Members\n\n25 First of all, the Requisitionists are plainly not members for the purposes of s 176(1) because their names do not appear on USP Group's Register of Members. In this regard, s 176(1) is explicit in using the term \"member\" to describe the parties who can requisition an EGM:\nConvening of extraordinary general meeting on requisition\n176.--(1) The directors of a company, despite anything in its constitution, must, on the requisition of members holding at the date of the deposit of the requisition not less than 10% of the total number of paid-up shares as at the date of the deposit carries the right of voting at general meetings or, in the case of a company not having a share capital, of members representing not less than 10% of the total voting rights of all members having at that date a right to vote at general meetings, immediately proceed duly to convene an extraordinary general meeting of the company to be held as soon as practicable but in any case not later than 2 months after the receipt by the company of the requisition.\n[emphasis added]\nThis reference to \"member\" also applies to other references to \"requisitionists\" appearing in s 176.\n26 As the learned authors of a leading local textbook say, the terms \"member\" and \"shareholder\" are distinct even if they are often used interchangeably (see Hans Tjio, Pearlie Koh & Lee Pey Woan, Corporate Law (Academy Publishing, 2015) (\"Corporate Law\") at p 155). Pursuant to ss 19(6) and 19(6A) of the Companies Act, in the case of a public company, a member is essentially a person whose name is entered in the register of members kept by the public company under s 190 of the Companies Act. A member does not necessarily own shares in the company. In contrast, a shareholder describes a person who, whether directly or indirectly, owns or otherwise has an interest in the shares of the company. Thus, as the learned authors of Corporate Law note, the Companies Act or the company's constitution may make specific reference to a company's members. In that instance, the provision concerned \"would apply only to members named in the company's register\" (at p 155). Perhaps tellingly, the learned authors of Corporate Law refer to the right of members to call for a meeting under s 177(1) of the Companies Act as an example whereby a right is expressly reserve to members whose names appear in the company's register of members. Section 177(1) is framed similarly to s 176(1), which also expressly reserves the right to call a meeting to members only.\n27 Furthermore, in the context of a public company whose book-entry securities are deposited with the CDP, s 81SJ(1) of the Securities and Futures Act 2001 (2020 Rev Ed) (\"SFA\") further provides as follows:\nDepositor not member of company and depositors deemed to be members\n81SJ.-- (1) Despite anything in the Companies Act 1967 or any other written law or rule of law or in any instrument or in the constitution of a corporation, where book-entry securities of the corporation are deposited with the Depository or its nominee --\n(a) the Depository or its nominee (as the case may be) is deemed not to be a member of the corporation; and\n(b) the persons named as the depositors in a Depository Register are, for such period as the book-entry securities are entered against their names in the Depository Register, deemed to be --\n(i) members of the corporation in respect of the amount of book-entry securities (relating to the stocks or shares issued by the corporation) entered against their respective names in the Depository Register; ...\nIn this connection, s 81SF of the SFA defines \"depositor\" to mean \"an account holder or a depository agent but does not include a sub-account holder\", while \"account holder\" is further defined to mean \"a person who has an account directly with the Depository and not through a depository agent\". Moreover, \"Depository\" is defined to include the CDP, and \"Depository Register\" means \"a register maintained by the Depository in respect of book-entry securities\". Accordingly, reading s 81SJ with s 81SF of the SFA, in respect of a public listed company whose shares may be held as book-entry securities through the CDP, its members are those whose names appear as account holders or depository agents in a register maintained by the CDP. More importantly, only those who directly hold an account with the CDP (which include the various brokerage houses in the present application) are deemed as members. Sub-account holders, such as the Requisitionists, are not deemed to be members.\n28 In the present case, it is clear that the Requisitionists' names do not appear on USP Group's Register of Members. Before me, Mr Joel Lim (\"Mr Lim\"), who appeared for the Requisitionists, argued that s 19(6A) of the Companies Act recognises as members persons who agree to become one. However, in the present case, as Mr Nichol Yeo (\"Mr Yeo\"), who appeared for USP Group, pointed out, there is simply no evidence that the Requisitionists had ever \"agreed\" to be members of USP Group. In any event, s 19(6A)(a) of the Companies Act also requires such persons, who agree to be members, to have their names entered in the register of members in order to qualify as members.\n29 Beyond this, the Requisitionists do not actually dispute that their names are not on USP Group's Register of Members. They, in fact, centre their arguments on USP Group being estopped from denying that they are not members. Accordingly, as a starting point, the Requisitionists do not come within the terms of s 176(1) to have the standing to requisition an EGM. It follows, unless there is some other way by which they can be recognised as \"members\" for the purposes of s 176(1), that the Requisition Notice will be accordingly invalid.\nThere are no other means for the Requisitionists to be recognised as \"members\" pursuant to s 176(1) of the Companies Act\n\n30 With this starting point, I turn to consider if there are other means for the Requisitionists to be recognised as \"members\" pursuant to s 176(1). The problem is that the Requisitionists are beneficial shareholders and hence their names do not appear in USP Group's Register of Members, nor are they deemed to be members under s 81SJ of the SFA. Rather, it is the brokerage houses who are the members. In this regard, I will consider (a) whether the Requisitionists' manner of making the Requisition Notice with the authority letters from the brokerage houses qualify them as \"members\", and (b) whether USP Group's constitution allows the brokerage houses to nominate the Requisitionists to exercise membership rights.\n31 Turning first to the correctness of the manner in which the Requisitionists tendered the Requisition Notice, the Ministry of Finance had set up a Steering Committee in 2007 to carry out a fundamental review of the Companies Act. The Steering Committee submitted its report to the Ministry in April 2011 (see Report of the Steering Committee for Review of the Companies Act (Ministry of Finance, April 2011) (Chairman: Prof Walter Woon) (\"Report\")). It suffices to say that the Ministry of Finance accepted the Steering Committee's recommendations that are relevant to the present case (see Ministry of Finance's Responses to the Report of the Steering Committee for Review of the Companies Act (Ministry of Finance, October 2012) at para 24).\n32 For present purposes, the Report considered the nomination of beneficial shareholders for the purpose of enjoying membership rights. It was noted in the Report (at para 64) that the UK Companies Act 2006 (c 46) (\"UK Companies Act 2006\") introduced two sets of provisions to (a) allow multiple proxies to enable indirect investors to participate in meetings (through ss 324 to 331), and (b) enable indirect investors to exercise members' rights (through ss 145 to 153). This was done to enfranchise indirect investors who hold their shares through an intermediary, such as a broker. More specifically, the Report explained that s 145 of the UK Companies Act 2006 removed any doubts as to the ability of companies to make provision in their articles (as the constitution was known at the time) to enfranchise indirect investors, and it further provides that such articles are legally effective (see Report at para 66). Additionally, ss 146 to 151 of the UK Companies Act 2006 enable indirect investors to be appointed by the registered member to receive company documents and information that are sent to members by companies traded on a regulated market (see Report at para 67).\n33 Perhaps most relevantly, ss 152 and 153 of the UK Companies Act 2006 in turn enable indirect investors, via the registered member, to exercise voting and requisition rights. I set out the relevant portions of ss 152 and 153 below:\n152 Exercise of rights where shares held on behalf of others: exercise in different ways\n(1) Where a member holds shares in a company on behalf of more than one person--\n(a) rights attached to the shares, and\n(b) rights under any enactment exercisable by virtue of holding the shares,\nneed not all be exercised, and if exercised, need not all be exercised in the same way.\n...\n153 Exercise of rights where shares held on behalf of others: members' requests\n(1) This section applies for the purposes of--\n(a) section 314 (power to require circulation of statement),\n(b) section 338 (public companies: power to require circulation of resolution for AGM),\n(ba) section 338A (traded companies: members' power to include matters in business dealt with at AGM),\n(c) section 342 (power to require independent report on poll), and\n(d) section 527 (power to require website publication of audit concerns).\n(2) A company is required to act under any of those sections if it receives a request in relation to which the following conditions are met--\n...\n(c) in the case of any of those persons who is not a member of the company, it is accompanied by a statement--\n(i) of the full name and address of a person (\"the member\") who is a member of the company and holds shares on behalf of that person,\n(ii) that the member is holding those shares on behalf of that person in the course of a business,\n(iii) of the number of shares in the company that the member holds on behalf of that person,\n(iv) of the total amount paid up on those shares,\n(v) that those shares are not held on behalf of anyone else or, if they are, that the other person or persons are not among the other persons making the request,\n(vi) that some or all of those shares confer voting rights that are relevant for the purposes of making a request under the section in question, and\n(vii) that the person has the right to instruct the member how to exercise those rights;\n...\n34 It is conceivable that, had our Companies Act contained a modified version of either ss 152 or 153 of the UK Companies Act 2006 to enable an indirect investor who is not a member of the company to make requests through a member with the appropriate statement, then the Requisitionists might have been able to justify the Requisition Notice that was accompanied by the authority letters from the brokerage houses. However, ss 152 and 153 were not adopted in Singapore. Indeed, the Report concluded that it was not necessary to adopt ss 145 to 153 of the UK Companies Act 2006 for the purposes of enfranchising indirect investors who hold shares through nominees. The Report noted summarily that it was sufficient to adopt a multiple proxies regime in Singapore for this purpose. In light of the intentional step taken not to enfranchise indirect investors in the way done in the UK Companies Act 2006, the Requisitionists cannot be deemed as \"members\" for the purposes of s 176(1) of the Companies Act by making the Requisition Notice on behalf of the brokerage houses and with the relevant authority letters. While I am conscious that my conclusion would deprive the Requisitionists as indirect investors of the right that would be accorded to members, I consider that to reach any other conclusion would, to adopt the words of Norris J in the analogous English High Court decision of In re DNick Holding plc [2013] 3 WLR 1316 (at [31]), require an impermissible form of judicial legislation.\n35 Second, I also considered if USP Group's constitution enables members to nominate other persons to enjoy or exercise membership rights. This would be consistent with the view expressed in the Report (at para 66) that it was not necessary to adopt s 145 of the UK Companies Act 2006 because it is \"merely an enabling provision protecting company articles that seek to enfranchise indirect investors\". Be that as it may, I do not see anything in USP Group's constitution that would enable the brokerage houses, who are the members, to nominate the Requisitionists to exercise membership rights, including the right to requisition an EGM pursuant to s 176(1). Nor did the Requisitionists argue otherwise in this regard.\n36 Therefore, I do not think that the Requisitionists can point to other means for them to be recognised as \"members\" within the meaning of s 176(1).\nUSP Group is not estopped from challenging the status of the Requisitionists as members\n\n37 I turn then to the argument that the Requisitionists have pressed the most strongly. In essence, the Requisitionists argue that USP Group is estopped, either by its general conduct since 26 October 2022 (when the Requisition Notice was first served), or by the High Court judgment in OA 894, from denying that the Requisitionists are \"members\" for the purposes of s 176(1) of the Companies Act. As I understand it, the Requisitionists are advancing two types of estoppel, namely, estoppel by convention and estoppel arising by judicial record. In my view, this argument can be addressed by recourse to a general point without even needing to consider the specific elements of the two types of estoppel argued for by the Requisitionists. This general point is whether an estoppel can prevent the application of a statutory rule. Put differently, assuming that USP Group had given the Requisitionists the wrong impression that the Requisitionists had standing as \"members\" under s 176(1), can an estoppel arise so as to hold USP Group to this incorrect application of s 176(1), despite the statutory basis of the rule?\n38 In summary, I am compelled to say that an estoppel cannot arise in this situation. This is because an estoppel would effectively allow the parties to apply a meaning of s 176(1) contrary to its correct interpretation. This is a conclusion I have arrived at reluctantly. As I have said above, I would very much prefer to have allowed the democratic process of USP Group to operate. However, that preference cannot overcome my duty to apply the law, especially the law of an imperative nature that has been prescribed by statute.\n(1) The applicable law\n\n39 I begin with the applicable law. In a helpful article, J A Andrews (\"Andrews\") explained that whether estoppel can operate against the application of a statutory rule would depend on the nature of the rule (see J A Andrews, \"Estoppels Against Statutes\" (1966) 29 MLR 1 at 3). This principle has been more broadly termed the defence of \"subversion\" and is justified on the basis that an estoppel should not subvert the public policy of a rule of law (see Piers Feltham et al, Spencer Bower: Reliance-Based Estoppel (Bloomsbury Publishing, 5th Ed, 2017) at para 7.1). Thus, in the High Court decision of Joshua Steven v Joshua Deborah Steven and others [2004] 4 SLR(R) 403, Tan Lee Meng J, adopting the principle set out in the Privy Council decision of Kok Hoong v Leong Cheong Kweng Mines, Ltd [1964] 1 All ER 300 (\"Kok Hoong\"), said (at [15]) that \"it is trite that a party cannot rely on estoppel in defiance of a statute\". For completeness, Viscount Radcliffe had explained in Kok Hoong as follows (at 305):\n... rules that preclude a court from allowing an estoppel, if to do so would be to act in the face of a statute and to give recognition through the admission of one of the parties to a state of affairs which the law has positively declared is not to subsist.\n40 However, as Mr Lim pointed out correctly, it is not that an estoppel can never apply just because a statute is involved. Rather, whether an estoppel can apply in the face of a statute will depend on the content of the statutory provision concerned. The Court of Appeal had accepted the correctness of this approach in Cupid Jewels Pte Ltd v Orchard Central Pte Ltd and another appeal [2014] 2 SLR 156 (at [37]), The Enterprise Fund III Ltd and others v OUE Lippo Healthcare Ltd (formerly known as International Healthway Corp Ltd) [2019] 2 SLR 524 at [122], and Rothstar Group Ltd v Leow Quek Shiong and other appeals [2022] 2 SLR 158 (\"Rothstar\") at [55]. In essence, as Steven Chong JCA held in Rothstar (at [55]): \"[i]t is well established that estoppel cannot operate where it would act in the face of a statute and effectively allow a state of affairs which the law has positively declared not to subsist\".\n41 Thus, if the statutory rule confers a duty on the parties, then an estoppel cannot arise to stop its application because individuals cannot be estopped from performing duties. In contrast, if the statutory rule merely recognises the rights and privileges of the parties in a particular situation, then an estoppel can apply in that case. Andrews therefore distinguishes between \"imperative\" and \"non-imperative\" rules. He suggests that there cannot be an estoppel against a statutory rule which is imperative in nature, ie, a rule which is made for the benefit of someone other than the person against whom the estoppel is asserted, and which the parties cannot otherwise avoid. However, Andrews observes that if the statutory rule is non-imperative in nature, ie, a rule of private law that is to be observed between individuals, then an estoppel can apply to prevent one party from asserting his right against the other (see \"Estoppels Against Statutes\" at 4-5). This approach amplifies what Lord Maugham had said in the Privy Council decision of Maritime Electric Company Limited v General Dairies, Ltd [1937] AC 610 (at 620):\n... where, as here, the statute imposes a duty of a positive kind, not avoidable by the performance of any formality, for the doing of the very act which the plaintiff seeks to do, it is not open to the defendant to set up an estoppel to prevent it. This conclusion must follow from the circumstance that an estoppel is only a rule of evidence which under certain special circumstances can be invoked by a party to an action; it cannot therefore avail in such a case to release the plaintiff from an obligation to obey such a statute, nor can it enable the defendant to escape from a statutory obligation of such a kind on his part. ...\n42 Indeed, in the cases where the courts have excluded the operation of an estoppel to deny the application of a statutory rule, it has been on the basis that a contrary decision would have allowed a person to achieve by an estoppel something that he could not otherwise lawfully do (see \"Estoppels Against Statutes\" at 5). As Michael Barnes points out, the applicable test could also be framed in the following manner (see The Law of Estoppel (Hart Publishing, 2020) at para 2.128):\nThe question of whether an estoppel can operate so as to contradict the purpose of a statutory provision is bound up with the question of whether parties can by an express contract remove the effect of a statutory provision (what is sometimes called 'contracting out' of the provision). It is generally correct to say that if a statutory provision cannot be overridden by agreement then equally the effect of the provision cannot be removed as a result of an estoppel. Accordingly when it comes to its relationship to statutory provisions, estoppel cannot be considered in isolation but is often bound up with the wider question of whether a statutory provision can be deprived of its effect by an agreement to do so.\n[emphasis added]\n(2) Application to the present case\n\n43 Applied to the present case, the question is whether the rule, that only \"members\" can exercise the right in s 176(1), is an imperative or non-imperative rule. In my view, it is an imperative rule. For reasons that I will elaborate on below, this is because the restriction to \"members\" applies to all members, including but not restricted to requisitionists who may wish to requisition an EGM.\n44 In this regard, the defendants argue that the rule in s 176(1) is non-imperative because the distinction between a shareholder and a member in the Companies Act in essence creates a benefit for the company and the member\/shareholder concerned, and not the public at large. In particular, the defendants rely on the Court of Appeal decision in Kitnasamy s\/o Marudapan v Nagatheran s\/o Manogar and another [2000] 1 SLR(R) 542 (\"Kitnasamy\") in submitting that a company can be estopped from denying that an entity is a member of a company under the Companies Act. In Kitnasamy, one of the issues was whether the appellant had standing to invoke s 216 of the Companies Act. This issue arose because, under s 216, only a member or a holder of a debenture of a company is entitled to seek relief. However, a Registry of Companies search did not show that the appellant was a registered shareholder of the company. This was despite the appellant's allegation that, according to the company's auditor, he was a registered shareholder, and that the Registry of Companies' records would be updated after the annual returns were filed (at [25]).\n45 The Court of Appeal held that the respondents were estopped from asserting that the appellant was not a member (at [27]). In coming to its conclusion, the court (at [26]) cited the Malaysian Federal Court decision of Owen Sim Liang Khui v Piasau Jaya Sdn Bhd & Anor [1996] 1 MLJ 113 (\"Owen Sim\") for the proposition that a respondent who was guilty of unconscionable or inequitable conduct would not be permitted to rely upon the requirement of membership in order to defeat a petitioner's standing as this would amount to him using the statute as an instrument of fraud. Having regard to the facts of that particular case, the court said (at [27]):\nOn the facts as pleaded by the appellant, even if he was not a registered shareholder, it seemed to us that this was an instance where the appellant had agreed to become a shareholder of the company and had rendered invaluable services to it and due to the default of those responsible for the administration of the company, including the respondents, the appellant's name as a shareholder was not entered in the register of the company. The belief of the appellant that he was a member was reinforced by the fact that the notice of an EGM scheduled for 14 January 2000, together with a proxy form, were despatched to him. Such documents are only despatched to members. The respondents were thus estopped from asserting that the appellant was not a member.\n46 To similar effect, the defendants rely on the UK Supreme Court decision of Tinkler v Revenue and Customs Commissioners [2021] 3 WLR 697 (\"Tinkler\"). In brief, the facts concerned whether the respondent was estopped from denying that the appellant, the tax authority, had validly opened a tax inquiry against him. The tax authority had failed to send a notice of enquiry to the respondent's place of residence or his place of business informing him that the tax authority had intended to enquire into his tax return, as required by statute, and the notice was never received by the respondent. However, the respondent was aware of the tax authority's enquiry and had engaged various professionals to assist him in responding to the said enquiry. The court held that the operation of the doctrine of estoppel by convention was not precluded by the statutory requirement that a notice of enquiry was to be given to the respondent, and justified its finding on the statutory purpose of the requirement (at [81]-[82]):\n81 The situation with which we are concerned is distinguishable. Section 9A TMA requires that a notice of enquiry is given to the taxpayer; and section 115(2) provides one method by which that notice may be given. But it would have been open to the parties (i e HMRC and Mr Tinkler) to agree expressly the method by which the notice of enquiry was to be given (including, it would seem, that a notice of enquiry given to Mr Tinkler's tax advisers would have counted). It follows from the TMA being permissive as to the method of giving notice that an estoppel by convention, by which HMRC and Mr Tinkler\/BDO operated on the basis that a valid enquiry had been opened (i e that a particular method had been used), does not undermine the purpose of the Act. As, applying the principles of estoppel by convention, Mr Tinkler is otherwise estopped from denying that HMRC opened a valid enquiry, there is nothing in the statutory provisions, purposively interpreted, that requires the court to reject that estoppel.\n82 There is an additional reason, on the facts, supporting that conclusion. We have seen, at para 15 above, that the FTT found that Mr Tinkler and\/or his PA knew of HMRC's enquiry in November 2005. Even if, contrary to the view taken in the last paragraph, the purpose of section 9A would otherwise be undermined by the operation of the estoppel by convention, there cannot be any conceivable undermining of the statutory purpose once the taxpayer actually knows of the enquiry. After November 2005, therefore, there has been no conceivable statutory reason why the taxpayer should be protected by rejecting the operation of estoppel by convention.\n[emphasis added]\n47 At this juncture, I pause to observe that while Kitnasamy and Tinkler both led to the outcome that the operation of estoppel was not precluded despite a statutory requirement, the courts appear to have reasoned differently in the two cases. In Kitnasamy, the Court of Appeal justified its conclusion on the broader notion that the doctrine of estoppel would prevent a party from relying on a statutory rule in answer to a claim made against him where such reliance would be unjust or inequitable (see Kitnasamy at [26] and Owen Sim at 134). In contrast, the UK Supreme Court in Tinkler considered whether the statutory purpose would be undermined if the doctrine of estoppel were to operate. The approach in Tinkler thus appears more similar to the position expressed in \"Estoppels Against Statutes\".\n48 Notwithstanding this difference in reasoning, Kitnasamy and Tinkler really centre on the distinction between imperative and non-imperative rules. This is simply another way of answering the question of whether: (a) the statutory rule in question is one which simply governs the rights and privileges between the parties in the dispute, which would allow parties to agree otherwise so long as it is consistent with the purpose underlying that rule, or whether (b) the rule is one which more broadly benefits a person or a class of persons other than the parties to the dispute, such that it would be inconsistent with the statutory purpose of the rule if it can be circumvented through the arrangements between the parties to the dispute (see also The Law of Estoppel at para 2.128).\n49 In the present case, I am of the view that s 176(1) of the Companies Act, which limits the right to requisition a meeting to \"members\" only, is not only for the benefit of the persons seeking to convene an EGM, but more broadly affects the company and its shareholders as well. This is despite the view expressed in the Report that companies can make provision in their constitutions to enfranchise indirect investors (at para 66). In this regard, I respectfully agree with the observations of the Malaysian High Court in NWP Holdings (at [11], citing another decision of the same court in Seacera Group Berhad v Dato' Tan Wei Lian & Ors [2019] MLJU 470 at [92]):\nEvery shareholder of a company has a right, subject to the statutory prescribed procedures and requirements, to call for an extraordinary general meeting of a company under our CA. A shareholder's right to convene a general meeting under Section 310(b) of the CA is one of the key rights provided by law to shareholders to marshal all shareholders of a company together at an appointed date, place and time to provide the opportunity to the shareholders to deliberate and to resolve, if deem fit, on proposals properly tabled before them that may affect the directions of the company. It is an essential right to invoke the internal democratic process of the company.\n[emphasis added]\n50 It is on, among others, this basis that Kitnasamy, which is otherwise binding on me, can be distinguished from the facts of the present case. First, Kitnasamy concerned the issue of whether the appellant had standing to make a claim in minority oppression under s 216 of the Companies Act. As the nature of a claim under s 216 is one which essentially seeks to vindicate a personal wrong committed against a shareholder of the company (see Ho Yew Kong v Sakae Holdings Ltd and other appeals and other matters [2018] 2 SLR 333 at [4]), the rule in s 216(1) of the Companies Act requiring that a claim in minority oppression under s 216 be made by \"[a]ny member or holder of a debenture of a company\" is not one which seeks to benefit any other person or class of persons other than the company. In such circumstances, it would, with respect, have been appropriate to allow the doctrine of estoppel to operate even though the appellant in that case was not a registered member of the company. This is not the case with s 176(1), as in the present situation.\n51 Second, Kitnasamy can also be distinguished from the facts of the present case because the appellant in that case qualified as a member for the purposes of s 216 of the Companies Act. In other words, the appellant fulfilled the statutory requirements in the Companies Act to qualify as a member. He was not registered as such only due to the default of the company concerned (at [25]). It was in that context that the court held that the respondents in Kitnasamy were estopped from denying that the applicants were members for a claim under s 216. The importance of this fact is underscored by the High Court decision of Lim Seng Wah and another v Han Meng Siew and others [2016] SGHC 177 (\"Lim Seng Wah\"), where Chua Lee Ming JC (as he then was) distinguished Kitnasamy in opining that no estoppel could arise against the respondents' assertion that the initial plaintiffs had lost their standing to continue with their s 216 claim. The learned judge observed that while the initial plaintiffs were shareholders when the action was commenced, they had ceased to be shareholders before the s 216 claim was decided. This was unlike the applicant in Kitnasamy who \"was for all intents and purposes a shareholder except that the company had not registered him as one\" (see Lim Seng Wah at [9] and [12]). Indeed, the present case is also quite unlike Kitnasamy. The Requisitionists, being indirect investors, simply do not qualify as members either by directly holding shares, by agreement or by a deeming statutory provision. It is therefore impermissible for an estoppel to apply so as to \"allow a state of affairs which the law has positively declared not to subsist\" (see Rothstar at [55]), the state of affairs here being that the Requisitionists do not qualify to be members for the purposes of s 176(1).\n52 In the end, given that the right of members to requisition a meeting is not one that affects just the requisitioning members and the company, I do not think that the Requisitionists can be allowed to circumvent the clear statutory requirement in s 176(1) by arguing for an estoppel that is premised on USP Group's mistaken conduct. While I can understand the Requisitionists' position, I do not think I can, in effect, ignore s 176(1) by deeming them as \"members\" when they clearly do not qualify as such pursuant to the terms of the Companies Act or the SFA. Put differently, however wrong USP Group's conduct was in leading the Requisitionists to believe that they had standing as \"members\", such conduct can never override the clear imperative rule prescribed by s 176(1). Regardless of any prejudice they now face by acting on USP Group's conduct since 26 October 2022, the Requisitionists cannot be allowed to achieve by an estoppel something that they otherwise could not lawfully do.\nUSP Group is not prevented by the extended doctrine of res judicata from challenging the status of the Requisitionists as members\n\n53 I turn then to the Requisitionists' argument that OA 218 is an abuse of process pursuant to the extended doctrine of res judicata as laid down by the English decision of Henderson v Henderson (1843) 3 Hare 100. The Requisitionists submit that USP Group's true motive in filing OA 218 is to frustrate the Requisitionists' attempt to convene the EGM to replace the current Board of Directors, and to mount a collateral attack on the OA 894 Order.\n(1) The applicable law\n\n54 The applicable law is not disputed. By the extended doctrine of res judicata, where a litigant seeks to argue points which were not previously determined by a court because they were not brought to the court's attention in earlier proceedings when they ought properly to have been raised and argued then, the litigant will not be permitted to argue those points in the absence of special circumstances (see The Royal Bank of Scotland NV (formerly known as ABN Amro Bank NV) and others v TT International Ltd (nTan Corporate Advisory Pte Ltd and others, other parties) and another appeal [2015] 5 SLR 1104 (\"The Royal Bank of Scotland\") at [101]). This is, as Sundaresh Menon JC (as he then was) put it in the High Court decision of Goh Nellie v Goh Lian Teck and others [2007] 1 SLR(R) 453 (\"Goh Nellie\") (at [19]), the defence of abuse of process. Further, as Lord Sumption explained in the UK Supreme Court decision of Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd v Zodiac Seats UK Ltd (formerly Contour Aerospace Ltd) [2014] AC 160 at [25], \"Res Judicata is a rule of substantive law, while abuse of process is a concept which informs the exercise of the court's procedural powers\".\n55 In deciding whether there has been such an abuse of process, it is instructive to pay heed to Lord Diplock's statement of principle in the House of Lords decision of Hunter v Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police and others [1982] AC 529 at 536:\n[Abuse of process] concerns the inherent power which any court of justice must possess to prevent [the] misuse of its procedure in a way which ... would nevertheless be manifestly unfair to a party to litigation before it, or would otherwise bring the administration of justice into disrepute among right-thinking people. The circumstances in which abuse of process can arise are very varied ... It would, in my view, be most unwise ... to say anything that might be taken as limiting to fixed categories the kinds of circumstances in which the court has a duty ... to exercise this salutary power.\nIn a similar vein, the Court of Appeal in The Royal Bank of Scotland cautioned that the inquiry is not a dogmatic one, but a \"broad, merits-based judgment which takes account of the public and private interests involved and also takes account of all the facts of the case\", including \"whether there is fresh evidence that might warrant re-litigation or whether there are bona fide reasons why a matter was not raised in the earlier proceedings\" (at [104]). More concretely, the Court of Appeal in Lim Geok Lin Andy v Yap Jin Meng Bryan and another appeal [2017] 2 SLR 760 (\"Andy Lim\") (at [44]) laid down the rule that the extended doctrine of res judicata is applicable \"where some connection can be shown between the party seeking to relitigate the issue and the earlier proceeding where that essential issue was litigated, which would make it unjust to allow that party to reopen the issue\" [emphasis in original].\n56 Ultimately, the court will exercise its discretion in such a way as to strike a balance between allowing a litigant with a genuine claim to have his day in court and ensuring that the litigation process would not be unduly oppressive to the defendant. In this regard, the court \"will be mindful of the considerations which led a claimant to act as he did\" (see Andy Lim at [44]). While it has been said that fairness or oppressiveness, as demonstrated by the facts of the case, is the decisive factor (see the Court of Appeal decision of Ong Han Nam v Borneo Ventures Pte Ltd [2021] 1 SLR 1248 at [71]), other factors that the court may consider include (see Goh Nellie at [53]): (a) whether the later proceedings are in substance nothing more than a collateral attack upon the previous decision; (b) whether there is fresh evidence that warranted re-litigation; (c) whether there were bona fide reasons why an issue that ought to have been raised in the earlier action was not; and (d) whether there are some other special circumstances that justify allowing the case to proceed.\n(2) Application to the present case\n\n57 In my judgment, while USP Group's bringing of OA 218 was very late in the day, I do not think that it amounted to an abuse of process that would prevent USP Group from arguing that the Requisitionists are not \"members\" under s 176(1).\n58 First, I do not think that OA 218 is a collateral attack on the decision in OA 894. To begin with, the \"threshold for abusive conduct is very high\" (see the Court of Appeal decision of AnAn Group (Singapore) Pte Ltd v VTB Bank (Public Joint Stock Co) [2020] 1 SLR 1158 at [99]). To find that a later civil proceeding is a \"collateral attack\" on a prior civil proceeding, it is relevant, though not determinative, to consider the nature of the two proceedings and the degree of overlap between them in terms of the issues and the supporting evidence that ought to be properly raised. In my view, a court should be less ready to find that a later proceeding is abusive if it is different in nature and purpose from the earlier proceeding that is raised in comparison with it. It is likely that, in such cases, the proper process to impugn the orders or judgment in the earlier proceeding is not by way of an appeal or some other process, but through a new proceeding. This consideration relates to the essence of the extended doctrine of res judicata, as encapsulated in the oft-cited words of Lord Bingham of Cornhill in the House of Lords decision of Johnson v Gore Wood & Co (a firm) [2002] 2 AC 1 (at 31): the \"crucial question [is] whether, in all the circumstances, a party is misusing or abusing the process of the court\".\n59 With the above principles in mind, I find that the present application in OA 218 is not a collateral attack on OA 894. The nature of this application, which concerns whether the Requisitionists are \"members\" under s 176(1), and consequently whether the EGM was validly requisitioned, is quite separate from the nature of the application in OA 894. The latter principally concerned, among others, the Requisitionists' request to extend time to convene an EGM pursuant to the court's power under s 392(4)(d) of the Companies Act. Indeed, USP Group did not take the position in the main hearing of OA 894 that an EGM should not be convened because it was invalidly requisitioned. Even though USP Group seeks to take this position now, it does not violate proper processes to ventilate this issue by way of a new application, instead of filing an appeal against OA 894. This is because the main substance of OA 894, which concerned a request for an extension of time (that was granted), might not fit well with the broader position that USP Group is now taking in OA 218. There is a likelihood that USP Group's position in this application would not find its proper forum in OA 894 to begin with. As such, I do not find that this application is a collateral attack on OA 894.\n60 Second, I find that there are special circumstances that justify allowing this application to proceed. Primarily, the issue of whether the Requisitionists are \"members\" within the meaning of s 176(1) is not without merit. In fact, from the parties' detailed submissions on the issues raised, it is clear that OA 218 involved a real issue of concern that a court should legitimately decide. It would be quite different if OA 218 were devoid of merit. In that case, it would be easier for the Requisitionists to portray it as an abuse of process. Moreover, the question of whether the Requisitionists are \"members\" or not does involve the public interest. This is since the effect of any exercise of a member's right to requisition a meeting would affect all other members as well. As such, there is a legitimate, albeit limited, public interest in OA 218 being heard and decided.\n61 Third, and perhaps more fundamentally, I am doubtful whether the extended doctrine of res judicata would apply to allow the parties to deviate from a statutory provision that is imperative in nature. It would be odd if the Requisitionists could obtain this outcome through the extended doctrine of res judicata when it is disallowed through the conventional estoppels. Given that the effect of the extended doctrine of res judicata is substantially the same as an estoppel, allowing the extended doctrine of res judicata to apply here would be legally incoherent, despite the admittedly different juridical bases of the doctrines. As such, for the reasons I have explained above as to why I do not think USP Group can be estopped from challenging the status of the Requisitionists as \"members\", I likewise do not think that USP Group can be prevented by the extended doctrine of res judicata from doing so.\n62 Accordingly, I conclude that USP Group is not prevented by the extended doctrine of res judicata from challenging the status of the Requisitionists as members for the purposes of s 176(1) of the Companies Act.\nConclusion\n\n63 More broadly, for all the reasons above, I make the declarations sought by USP Group in OA 218. I find that the Requisitionists do not have standing to requisition the EGM pursuant to s 176(1), such that the Requisition Notice is invalid. In the end, as much as I am not impressed by USP Group's conduct in relation to the intended EGM, it is also not appropriate to make bad law in any case, let alone a hard case. While it may be tempting to say that the \"justice\" of the case requires a different outcome, it is also important that such recourse to \"justice\" does not detract from a proper and rigorous analysis of the facts and law. Indeed, it should be recognised that there are different facets to \"justice\". The maintenance of a coherent fabric of the law, which can be applied consistently and with certainty in case after case, is also an important consideration. That said, coherence cannot be pursued at the cost of grave injustice in an instant case. Therefore, the balance of justice in each case must be weighed carefully and objectively with especial regard to the specific facts. The recourse to \"justice\" requires such in every case. In the present case, the need to maintain coherence in the fabric of the law is balanced against the fact that my decision does not bar the Requisitionists from requisitioning another EGM within a relatively short time after taking certain steps.\nOA 156\n\n64 As I alluded to at the start of this judgment, I make no order as to Tanoto's secondary prayer in OA 156 for an interim injunction against the EGM. This is because there is no EGM pursuant to the Requisition Notice for any injunction to apply to. As for Tanoto's primary prayer in OA 156 for permission under s 216A of the Companies Act (\"s 216A\") to bring an action in the name and on behalf of USP Group for an injunction to restrain the Requisitionists from ever requisitioning an EGM under s 176(1), I decline to grant such permission for the reasons below.\n65 In reaching my decision, I had rejected Ms Neo's attempt during the hearing to recharacterise this primary prayer as one for an injunction only until the completion of investigations into the Requisitionists' shareholding. This is firstly because the plain words of the primary prayer, which I reproduce below, clearly contemplates a permanent injunction that is not restricted until the completion of any investigation:\nThat pursuant to Section 216A of the Companies Act, the Applicant be granted leave to bring an action in the name and on behalf of USP Group Limited (Singapore UEN No. 200409104W) against (1) Hinterland Energy Pte Ltd (Singapore UEN No. 202128584W), (2) Harmonic Brothers Pte Ltd (Singapore UEN No. 202127026N), (3) Hia Yi Heng (NRIC No. [redacted]), and (4) Lim Shi Wei (NRIC No. [redacted]) (the \"Requisitionists\") for an injunction preventing the Requisitionists from requisitioning an Extraordinary General Meeting (\"EGM\") under Section 176 of the Companies Act (2020 Rev Ed), and an Order that any requisition notice already issued by the Requisitionists be rendered void.\n66 As will be observed, there is clearly no mention of any investigation in this prayer as framed in OA 156. As such, it would not be right to allow Tanoto to, in effect, amend this prayer during the hearing itself when prior notice had not been accorded to the Requisitionists. Furthermore, it is clear that some of the reasons advanced in support of this primary prayer have nothing to do with the allegedly pending investigations. For example, as we shall see, Tanoto alleges that the Requisitionists should be prevented from requisitioning another EGM as there are pending lawsuits which USP Group is presently engaged in. However, I fail to see how this reason would support the primary prayer if it were now tied to the end of the supposed investigations. I will accordingly deal with the primary prayer as it is framed, ie, for a permanent injunction to restrain the Requisitionists from ever requesting for an EGM. In any event, even if I had acceded to Ms Neo's attempt to restrict the prayer, I would also have dismissed it for the reasons below.\nThe applicable law\n\n67 I turn then to the applicable law. To begin with, the legal requirements of an application under s 216A are not in dispute. Section 216A provides as follows:\nDerivative or representative actions\n216A.--(1) In this section and section 216B, \"complainant\" means --\n(a) any member of a company;\n(b) the Minister, in the case of a declared company under Part 9; or\n(c) any other person who, in the discretion of the Court, is a proper person to make an application under this section.\n(2) Subject to subsection (3), a complainant may apply to the Court for permission to bring an action or arbitration in the name and on behalf of the company or intervene in an action or arbitration to which the company is a party for the purpose of prosecuting, defending or discontinuing the action or arbitration on behalf of the company.\n(3) No action or arbitration may be brought and no intervention in an action or arbitration may be made under subsection (2) unless the Court is satisfied that --\n(a) the complainant has given 14 days' notice to the directors of the company of the complainant's intention to apply to the Court under subsection (2) if the directors of the company do not bring, diligently prosecute or defend or discontinue the action or arbitration;\n(b) the complainant is acting in good faith; and\n(c) it appears to be prima facie in the interests of the company that the action or arbitration be brought, prosecuted, defended or discontinued.\n68 From a plain reading of s 216A, there are, broadly speaking, four legal requirements that the complainant must satisfy: (a) the complainant must first have standing to bring the application; (b) the complainant must have given the requisite notice to the directors of the defendants; (c) the complainant must show that he is acting in good faith; and (d) it appears to the court that it is prima facie in the interests of the company that the action be brought.\n69 I will consider the specifically applicable law below.\nMy decision: Tanoto has no basis to bring a derivative action for a permanent injunction against the Requisitionists\nTanoto has not shown that USP Group has any reason to obtain an injunction against the Requisitionists\n\n70 First, the Requisitionists argue that permission should not be granted under s 216A because Tanoto has not shown a cause of action that USP Group has, or may have, against the Requisitionists, which will result in the remedy of an injunction. In my view, this argument relates to the objective legal merits of the proposed action. This, in the context of an application under s 216A of the Companies Act, in turn relates to the issue of whether the proposed action is prima facie in the interests of the company. As the Court of Appeal opined in Ang Thiam Swee v Low Hian Chor [2013] 2 SLR 340 (at [58]), there is a \"natural affinity between the interests of the company in prosecuting a statutory derivative action and the legal merits of that action\", in the sense that it \"cannot conceivably be prima facie within the interests of the company to bring an action which is wholly without any legitimate or arguable basis\".\n71 In support of their argument that there is no basis for USP Group to succeed in obtaining an injunction against the Requisitionists, the Requisitionists cite Lord Diplock's statement in the House of Lords decision of Siskina v Distos Compania Naviera SA [1979] AC 210 (at 256) (which was cited with approval in the Court of Appeal decision of Bi Xiaoqiong (in her personal capacity and as trustee of the Xiao Qiong Bi Trust and the Alisa Wu Irrevocable Trust) v China Medical Technologies, Inc (in liquidation) and another [2019] 2 SLR 595 (\"Bi Xiaoqiong\") at [67] and which I reproduce below):\n... A right to obtain an interlocutory injunction is not a cause of action. It cannot stand on its own. It is dependent upon there being a pre-existing cause of action against the defendant arising out of an invasion, actual or threatened by him, of a legal or equitable right of the plaintiff for the enforcement of which the defendant is amenable to the jurisdiction of the court. The right to obtain an interlocutory injunction is merely ancillary and incidental to the pre-existing cause of action.\n[emphasis in original]\n72 While the Requisitionists do not spell this out definitively, it appears that they rely on the words \"bring an action\" in s 216A(2) to argue that there must be an underlying cause of action for the company to prosecute. To this end, they cite the High Court decision of Jian Li Investments Holding Pte Ltd and others v Healthstats International Pte Ltd and others [2019] 4 SLR 825 (\"Jian Li\") at [42]. However, I do not think that s 216A(2) is so narrow as to limit the applicant to only bringing a \"cause of action\" in the name and on behalf of the company against another party. This would be adding an impermissible gloss to the clear statutory text. Rather, the word \"action\" should be given a broad interpretation to refer to proceedings that the company has standing to commence and can encompass, as in the present case, an injunction that is not tied to an underlying cause of action.\n73 As such, it is first important to characterise the substance of the primary prayer in OA 156. In my view, the Requisitionists are putting the cart before the horse when they say that Tanoto's primary prayer fails because he does not rely on any independent cause of action, without first establishing whether the nature of the prayer requires him to do this. In this regard, I find that OA 156 is, in substance, an application for a permanent freestanding injunction. It is unlike other permanent injunctions which are remedies granted after a cause of action is made out (see the Court of Appeal decision of RGA Holdings International Inc v Loh Choon Phing Robin and another [2017] 2 SLR 997 at [32] for an example of when a final injunction may be granted). In relation to a freestanding injunction, there is no requirement that there must be an underlying cause of action (see the High Court decision of Sulzer Pumps Spain, SA v Hyflux Membrane Manufacturing (S) Pte Ltd and another [2020] 5 SLR 634 (\"Hyflux Membrane\") at [79]). Indeed, Aedit Abdullah J held in Hyflux Membrane that the court has the power to grant such an injunction in the exercise of its equitable jurisdiction (at [91]). Additionally, as observed by the learned judge in that case (at [89]), this position also finds support in the decision of Lord Scott of Foscote in the House of Lords decision of Fourie v Le Roux and others [2007] 1 WLR 320 (at [25]). I respectfully adopt the position that these authorities advance.\n74 Turning then to consider the principles upon which the court should exercise its equitable jurisdiction to grant a freestanding injunction, Abdullah J had explained in Hyflux Membrane that the purpose of granting a freestanding injunction is to prevent injustice (at [92]). To this end, a germane question to ask is whether the applicant has provided credible evidence to show that it would suffer unjust detriment if the respondent's conduct were not restrained.\n75 Applying these principles, I find that Tanoto has not provided any credible evidence to show that USP Group has any reason to seek a freestanding injunction against the Requisitionists. This is because, on Tanoto's own case, the investigations against the Requisitionists' shareholding are still ongoing. Until those investigations are completed, there is no evidence that the Requisitionists have done anything wrong, such that refusing to grant a freestanding injunction restraining the Requisitionists from ever requisitioning an EGM would cause detriment to USP Group.\n76 In any case, I reject Tanoto's account that the investigations are still ongoing. To begin with, in Tanoto's affidavit submitted in support of OA 156, all that he says in relation to the investigations is \"[t]o date, investigations are ongoing and the legitimacy of the manner through which the Requisitionists have obtained their shares has not been conclusively ascertained by the relevant authorities\". However, Tanoto only exhibits a police report one Mr Ng Kheng Jen (\"Mr Ng\") made in relation to the matter on 29 December 2022. There is otherwise no indication that investigations against the Requisitionists are still \"ongoing\".\n77 When I asked Ms Neo about this during the hearing, she candidly admitted that Tanoto had no documentary evidence to prove that the investigations are ongoing. She, however, pointed me to a letter dated 9 Feburary 2023 from her law firm that was sent to USP Group's Board of Directions on Tanoto's instructions. Ms Neo explained that the letter contains Tanoto's instructions that \"[t]he matter [referring to the Requisitionists' shareholding] is currently being investigated by the Commercial Affairs Department (\"CAD\").\" Ms Neo said that since USP Group's Board of Directors did not object to this letter, its contents must be taken to be true. I reject this submission. Indeed, when I asked Ms Neo how Tanoto knows that the CAD had begun investigations against the Requisitionists, she said that her instructions are that Tanoto said that Mr Ng had informed him that he (Mr Ng) received a call from the CAD that they were investigating the Requisitionists. I find this entire account unbelievable. If, as Tanoto says, the entire premise of OA 156 rests on the investigations, I find it hard to account for why he did not include such an important point in his affidavit. Moreover, it was only upon my questioning that Ms Neo gave me the answer - during the hearing itself - about how Mr Ng was informed by the CAD of the pending investigations, which is, of course, conveniently not documented. The fact is that there is simply no credible evidence which shows that there are ongoing investigations against the Requisitionists.\n78 For these reasons, I find that Tanoto has not shown that there are current ongoing investigations against the Requisitionists. Without such investigations, Tanoto cannot even begin to show how USP Group has any reason to seek an injunction against the Requisitionists. This alone suffices for me to conclude that Tanoto's proposed action is not prima facie in the interests of USP Group. Consequently, Tanoto's primary prayer, whether characterised as a permanent injunction or until such time as the investigations are completed, should be dismissed.\nTanoto is not acting in good faith\n\n79 Moreover, I also find that Tanoto's primary prayer should be dismissed on the basis that he is not acting in good faith. In this regard, Ang Cheng Hock JC (as he then was) summarised the elements of the good faith requirement under s 216A(3)(b) of the Companies Act in the High Court decision of Jian Li (at [42] and [44]):\n42 There are two main facets to the 'good faith' requirement: Ang Thiam Swee at [29]-[30]; Maher v Honeysett and Maher Electrical Contractors [2005] NSWSC 859 at [28]. The first relates to the merits of the proposed derivative action. The applicant must honestly or reasonably believe that a good cause of action exists for the company to prosecute. It follows as a corollary that an applicant may be found to lack good faith if it is shown that no reasonable person in his position, and knowing what he knows, could believe that the company had a good cause of action to prosecute: Ang Thiam Swee at [29].\n...\n44 Secondly, an applicant may be found to be lacking in good faith if it can be demonstrated that he is bringing the derivative action for a collateral purpose: Ang Thiam Swee at [30]. The onus is on the applicant to demonstrate that he or she is 'genuinely aggrieved', and that any collateral purpose is sufficiently consistent with the purpose of 'doing justice to a company' so that he or she is not abusing the statutory remedy and, by extension, also the company, as a vehicle for the applicant's own aims and interests: Ang Thiam Swee at [31], citing Pang Yong Hock and another v PKS Contracts Services Pte Ltd [2004] 3 SLR(R) 1 ('Pang Yong Hock') at [19].\nThus, if Tanoto honestly or reasonably believed that a good action exists (ie, he is acting in good faith), then it is more probable that the proposed action is indeed being brought for USP Group's interests, which then fulfils the underlying rationale of the s 216A action.\n80 Considering this, I do not think that Tanoto has a reasonable belief that a good action exists. As I have said, Tanoto is effectively seeking a permanent injunction to restrain the Requisitionists from ever requisitioning for an EGM. To my mind, this is patently unreasonable because Tanoto has not shown credible evidence that warrant such a draconian outcome.\n81 First, Tanoto points out that the Requisitionists may have obtained their shares in an improper and pre-arranged manner. Be that as it may, as I have already explained, even on Tanoto's own case, investigations into this matter are currently ongoing. If there is no conclusive determination at this time, I can hardly see how a permanent injunction against the Requisitionists can rest on this matter. In any event, for the reasons above, I am not even sure that there are any ongoing investigations against the Requisitionists.\n82 Second, Tanoto says that handing control of USP Group over to the Requisitionists, whose interest and motives may be questionable, may not be in USP Group's interest. However, the Requisitionists are simply seeking an EGM to allow the democratic process of the company to take place. Whether that process will result in the Requisitionists taking control is unknown before the EGM has taken place. In this case, granting the injunction Tanoto seeks would severely undermine the democratic process within USP Group. It would also entrench the current Board of Directors against any new board that the Requisitionists may bring forward. This is not acceptable.\n83 Third, Tanoto says that USP Group is currently embroiled in four lawsuits. As such, he says that allowing the EGM to proceed at this time would distract the current Board from the proper management of the ongoing lawsuits. This is especially because Tanoto is a key witness in the lawsuits. In my view, this is not a good reason for a permanent injunction. It is clear that all lawsuits will end at some time, even if, at the time they are ongoing, they seem like an eternity to the parties concerned. If the lawsuits will end, then what basis is there for a permanent injunction against the Requisitionists from ever requisitioning for an EGM? In any event, whether Tanoto is a key witness in those lawsuits or not is irrelevant to the question of whether he should continue to remain as a director. This is because he is presumably being called as a witness in relation to his knowledge as a director at the material times, which would relate to matters in the past. This does not require him to stay on as a director of USP Group.\n84 Fourth, Tanoto says that the first resolution at the intended EGM to remove him from his role as CEO at USP Group is ultra vires because the company's constitution provides that this is a matter for the Board, and not the shareholders, to decide. Even if this resolution is ultra vires, why should that be extrapolated to prevent the Requisitionists from ever requisitioning another EGM where such a resolution may not be put forward? In my view, the fact that Tanoto even makes such an argument shows that he is not acting in good faith.\n85 For all of these reasons, I do not think that Tanoto has a reasonable belief that a good action exists. Indeed, the fact that Ms Neo, on Tanoto's instructions, sought to constrain the prayers sought during the hearing itself, adds to this finding. In sum, the facts do not warrant the permanent injunction which Tanoto seeks. For completeness, even if I were to agree with Ms Neo's renewed interpretation of Tanoto's primary prayer, I would also have found that the facts do not warrant an injunction until such time when the investigations against the Requisitionists are completed, simply because I am not convinced there are any such investigations. I therefore dismiss Tanoto's primary prayer under OA 156 on the further ground that he has not acted in good faith.\nConclusion\n\n86 For all these reasons, despite USP Group and Tanoto's conduct, the outcome of my decision is that the intended EGM on 21 April 2023 need not proceed. This is because I am compelled to find that the Requisitionists are not \"members\" of USP Group for the purposes of s 176(1). I accordingly make the declaration to this effect in OA 218. I also declare that the Requisition Notice is invalid for the purposes of s 176(1).\n87 While I have found in favour of USP Group in OA 218, I do not think that it is satisfactory for USP Group to stifle the Requisitionists' attempts to call for an EGM (even if I do not find that the filing of OA 218 itself is an abuse of process). It is especially not acceptable that USP Group has ignored the OA 894 Order in the period before it filed OA 218. This is a blatant disregard of a court order that cannot be countenanced. However, as I have said, I am compelled by the law to make the declarations sought by USP Group in OA 218. Were it otherwise, I would not have in any way condoned USP Group's conduct by effectively allowing it to delay the EGM which the Requisitionists desire to hold. It is unacceptable that USP Group is trying to disrupt the democratic processes of the company, as demonstrated (indirectly, at least) by Tanoto's tenuous arguments in OA 156.\n88 In the premises, I understand that the Requisitionists would need to take certain steps, such as opening CDP accounts to hold the shares of USP Group, to come within the definition of a \"member\" under s 176(1). I therefore give the Requisitionists liberty to apply for the relevant orders to compel USP Group to furnish it with the relevant documentations that would enable them to set up the accounts to hold the shares in question. This would enable the Requisitionists to become \"members\" for the purposes of s 176(1) as soon as practicable. When the Requisitionists do so, they can make a fresh requisition for an EGM pursuant to s 176(1). I recognise that this means the intended EGM will be delayed again. But at the very least, it can still be held in the not-too-distant future. Further, given that the Requisitionists have not particularised the prejudice that they would suffer due to this delay, save for general concerns about the well-being of USP Group, I am comforted that, despite my ruling today that is compelled by the law, the Requisitionists should be able to requisition an EGM soon enough with no great substantive harm. While, as Ms Neo rightly pointed out before me, Tanoto (or USP Group) would then have every right to apply for an injunction against such an EGM, I would urge the parties to consider their positions carefully and not raise arguments that are simply not made out by the evidence.\n89 Unless the parties are able to agree, they are to write in with their written submissions on the appropriate costs orders for both OA 218 and OA 156 within 14 days of this decision.\n90 In closing, regardless of what I have said about any party's conduct in these proceedings, I would like to record my thanks to all counsel for their helpful submissions. In particular, with respect to OA 218, which involved some difficult issues of law relating to the effectiveness of an estoppel in the face of a statute, I would like to thank both Mr Yeo and Mr Lim

It is the proprietor of the registered trademark \"OTO\" which covers, among other things, massage apparatus in Class 10, a category designated for medical and surgical equipment. The word \"OTO\" (\"the plaintiff's trademark\") is represented in italicised form and set in horizontally striped block letters in a rectangular background (see Annex A). Since 1999, the plaintiff adopted a slightly modified representation of the trademark (see Annex B) in that the word OTO is now in prominent, plain white block text with horizontal stripes on the lower half of the letters, set in a green box. In addition, there is the word \"Bodycare\", also in plain white block text set out in smaller type than the word \"OTO\", in a red box below the said green box. This new mark is awaiting registration. The central and distinctive theme is the word \"OTO\" in both instances.\n3 In 2002, the plaintiff imported into Singapore an electrical reflexology apparatus which was developed, designed and patented in Korea by a manufacturer there in collaboration with a medical equipment company. This apparatus' innovative circuitry was patented in 2000. After extensive testing of the apparatus, the plaintiff obtained the rights to market it in Singapore under its own trademark. The plaintiff also coined the term \"Electro-Reflexologist\" for this apparatus. It was also known as ER839.\n4 The apparatus in question did not use rollers like other massage equipment. Instead, it used low-frequency electrical waves to simulate the traditional manual foot reflexology massage by stimulating the body's muscles and organs through the nerve points on the feet. It was said that this improved blood circulation and promoted health generally.\n5 The design of this apparatus featured a sloping rectangular platform angled to the horizontal floor so that the user could rest his feet comfortably on the platform. It had a plain, metallic casing with two rubberised pads on top, shaped like two feet, with each pad divided into seven separate areas. These pads were designed to guide the user intuitively to place his feet on them. The seven separate areas were designed to massage specific areas of the feet with the electrical waves in order to achieve optimal results from the reflexology session. A control panel was built in between the two rubberised pads.\n6 The plaintiff asserted that there was goodwill associated with \"OTO\" and \"Electro-Reflexologist\". When it launched the product here in June 2002, it was one of the first electrical reflexology products in the market. Although there were other brands in the market, their designs were dissimilar to that of the plaintiff. The plaintiff advertised extensively and promoted the product through various channels, spending some $1.857m on such advertisement and promotion.\n7 The plaintiff had ten exclusive outlets or specialty shops located in various parts of Singapore selling its products. The products were displayed for demonstration in an open concept and the public would be invited to try them out. Trained personnel attended to the prospective customers. One of these outlets was located on the third level of Sim Lim Square at Rochor Canal Road. Road shows were regularly organised at shopping malls in order to have a wider outreach.\n8 In the plaintiff's advertisements, not only was the name \"Electro-Reflexologist\" emphasised, the picture of the apparatus was also prominently displayed. The product turned out to be very successful. Between June 2002 and April 2004, the plaintiff sold more than 75,000 units of it, earning revenue amounting to some $28m. As a result, the plaintiff claimed that a great deal of public awareness of its product had been generated and the public had come to associate not just \"OTO\" and \"OTO Bodycare\" but also \"Electro-Reflexologist\" and the distinctive shape and get-up of its product with the plaintiff and no one else.\n9 The defendant was a sole proprietor trading as Blackgold Asia Pacific which had a place of business at Tong Eng Building at Cecil Street. In early 2004, he was using a shop in Chinatown Point as his warehouse and office. In June 2004, after the plaintiff commenced this action against him, the defendant incorporated a new company known as Infinitus Pleasures Pte Ltd which had its registered office in Aljunied Road.\n10 Around December 2003, the plaintiff became aware that the defendant was selling a foot reflexology apparatus known as HL1016, which was identical to or substantially similar in design to the plaintiff's product, in the atrium of Sim Lim Square. The defendant also rented part of a shop on the second level of Sim Lim Square to sell ink cartridges for inkjet printers. He apparently also had an outlet on the fourth level. Subsequent investigations revealed that the defendant stocked his goods at the Chinatown Point premises and also sold the product from that location.\n11 At Sim Lim Square, the defendant displayed a few large colour posters with the words \"OTC BODYCARE\" with \"OTC\" in white set in a red box and with horizontal stripes running through the letters (see Annex C). The letters were in a plain, bold typeface such that the letter \"C\" would appear like the letter \"O\". The letters \"TM\" in white appeared as a superscript to \"OTC\". The word \"BODYCARE\" was also in white set against a green background with the word \"JAPAN\" in small black type below it. The colour scheme of the defendant's posters was identical to that of the plaintiff except that colours were interchanged. I shall refer to this logo as \"the defendant's mark\".\n12 The flyers distributed by the defendant also had the defendant's mark at the top and bottom of the page. At the bottom of the page, there were also the words, \"Finest Quality Product Brought to you by OTC Bodycare\". There was no entity known as OTC Bodycare. The flyers stated that there was a \"Chinese New Year offer\" which was valid from 1 January to 21 January 2004.\n13 When the plaintiff's investigators visited the Chinatown Point premises, they saw three posters measuring about 80cm by 60cm depicting the defendant's mark and the words \"SLIMMING BEAUTY & HEALTH\" below it. These posters were pasted across the top glass panel of the premises. The plaintiff was of the view that \"OTC\" and the defendant's layout were deceptively similar to the plaintiff's trademark and the new mark such that there was infringement of trademark and passing off.\n14 On some of the flyers distributed by the defendant, there was a little sticker which stated, \"Visit Our Authorized Agent at the Atrium Of Sim Lim Square\". The plaintiff had a sales outlet on the third level of that commercial building. Adopting the same sales methods used by the plaintiff, the defendant's products were laid out on the floor in the atrium and prospective customers were invited to try the products. The defendant also used red and blue armchairs which were identical to those used by the plaintiff at its road shows. This, the plaintiff believed, was calculated to create the impression that the defendant was an agent of a larger organisation called OTC Bodycare Japan and that this organisation was related to OTO Bodycare. The tactic employed by the defendant could result in consumers being misled into thinking that he was an agent of the plaintiff. In any event, the geographical source stated in the defendant's mark was false as the defendant's disclosed documents revealed that his goods originated from China and not Japan. The statement in the defendant's flyers, \"90,000 units sold in Japan during first month of launch\", was also false as the product had not been marketed in Japan. It was also untrue, as claimed in the flyers, that the defendant's product was patented.\n15 The defendant's product was named \"Electro-Relaxologist\", a word visually and phonetically similar to the plaintiff's \"Electro-Reflexologist\". Its design was virtually identical to that of the plaintiff's product in its physical dimensions, its rectangular shape, its sloping platform, the metallic casing, the rubberised footpads and the operation panel between the two footpads. The name and design were therefore copies of the plaintiff's product.\n16 The packaging of the defendant's product resembled that of the plaintiff's. The name of the defendant's product was placed at the top right hand corner of the box, just like the plaintiff's. On the front and back panels of the defendant's packaging, there was a picture of an attractive young Caucasian woman placed just as in the plaintiff's packaging, although a different model was used and a different seating posture was adopted. The model on the plaintiff's box was dressed in a bathrobe while the model on the defendant's box was in street clothes. Immediately under the text box of the plaintiff's packaging, there were three lines describing the product's virtues. These were copied by the defendant and three more lines were added by him.\n17 On one of the side panels of the plaintiff's box, there was a text box with descriptive words of the plaintiff's product. The defendant copied the words but replaced \"Reflex\" with \"Relax\" indiscriminately, thereby rendering the sentences in his boxes meaningless. On the other side panel, there was a graphic of the human feet. This was again copied by the defendant with the substitution of the words mentioned earlier. In fact, at two points, the word \"Reflex\" was apparently overlooked and left there.\n18 The overall effect was such that the differences between the two products were so slight that they were not likely to be noticed by the unwary consumer. In fact, the market survey commissioned by the plaintiff indicated that 45% of the plaintiff's recent customers thought that the two products looked like they were from the same company and 70% thought that their names were the same.\n19 The instruction manual inside the plaintiff's packaging also appeared to have been copied wholesale by the defendant. Indeed, where the Chinese version of the instruction manual was concerned, six typographical errors made by the plaintiff were repeated by the defendant. The defendant produced no evidence to show that his packaging and manuals had been developed independently. He claimed that contractual documents and other communications with his supplier in China were lost when he moved office.\n20 Yep claimed that the actions of the defendant were calculated to cause and did cause the plaintiff significant damage. The plaintiff's product cost a few hundred dollars each and consumers would not be expected to purchase more than one unit for their needs. Therefore, every unit sold by the defendant translated into one sale less for the plaintiff. Further, the quality of the defendant's product was questionable. Some were found not to be working properly. An entire shipment of the product sold to Gnee Hong Co Pte Ltd in Singapore had to be returned because of problems with quality. If members of the public were duped into thinking they had purchased the plaintiff's product, the damage to the plaintiff's goodwill and reputation would be incalculable. The infringing product could also pose a health hazard as it ran on electricity.\n21 On 5 January 2004, Yep instructed one of his staff members to buy one unit of the defendant's product from the stall at the atrium of Sim Lim Square. One Ivan sold the unit to him for $338. The receipt stated, \"1 set of HL Electro-Relaxologist\", showing that the defendant was trying to pass off his product as the plaintiff's. On 15 January 2004, the plaintiff issued a letter to the defendant to put him on notice of the trade mark infringement and of the passing off. However, the wrongful acts continued.\n22 On 7 February 2004, this action was commenced. Two days later, an interlocutory injunction was obtained restraining the defendant from dealing with materials carrying the name \"OTC BODYCARE JAPAN\" and from selling or distributing electrical foot massage or reflexology apparatus under the name \"FOOT RELAXOLOGIST\". The plaintiff's solicitor telephoned the defendant to inform him of the issue of the injunction. A copy each of the Writ of Summons and of the injunction were served on the defendant's employee, Ivan Cheah (\"Ivan\"). On 12 February 2004, a private investigator engaged by the plaintiff managed to purchase one unit of the defendant's Electro-Relaxologist for $250 from the stall at the atrium of Sim Lim Square. Investigations revealed that the defendant was still distributing and selling the infringing product up to 4 March 2004. The erroneous term, \"FOOT RELAXOLOGIST\", was corrected by an amendment made on 3 March 2004 to read as \"ELECTRO-RELAXOLOGIST\".\n23 On 6 March 2004, the defendant placed an advertisement in the Tamil Murasu newspaper offering his product at a clearance sales price. The sale of the product at the said atrium continued under a business called JIT Engineering Services (\"JIT\") but with Ivan and another salesman, Patrick Ong (\"Patrick\"), handling the sales. However, the name \"Electro-Relaxologist\" was cut off from the product's packaging. When asked, Ivan said that his boss was the defendant who owned four companies, including Blackgold Asia Pacific and JIT.\n24 On 15 April 2004, JIT advertised in the Straits Times that it was selling the infringing product. That day, the plaintiff's staff purchased one unit at a covered walkway in the Tampines housing estate. The receipt was issued by JIT. A further advertisement was taken out by JIT in the Chinese newspapers on 23 April 2004.\n25 Telephone records of the defendant's mobile phone showed that he was in constant communication with Ivan between 1 June and 15 September 2004. At a new sales outlet in the then Majestic cinema complex in Chinatown, the defendant was still using an instruction leaflet with the word \"Electro-Relaxologist\".\n26 The plaintiff engaged Asian Strategies Pte Ltd, a company specialising in undertaking consumers' research reports, to do a market survey to assess the likelihood of confusion among consumers between the plaintiff's OTO Electro-Reflexologist and the defendant's HL Electro-Relaxologist by determining the recognition of the form factor of the plaintiff's machine and of the name, Electro-Reflexologist. After conducting interviews of 400 consumers who had purchased an OTO machine in the preceding twelve months, it was found that:\n(a) when shown photographs of OTO and HL outer packaging, 32% of the interviewees felt that they would confuse the two brands;\n(b) when shown photographs of the two machines, 44% felt they would confuse the two brands and only 21% thought they would definitely not confuse them;\n(c) 70% thought that the terms, \"Electro-Reflexologist\" and \"Electro-Relaxologist\" were the same or did not notice the difference in the context of the logos; and\n(d) 45% thought that the two products looked like they were from the same company and 15% were unsure.\nThe survey company concluded that there was a significant level of confusion among the recent buyers of the plaintiff's product in Singapore in terms of both form factor and product name. It also stated that the actual level of confusion in the marketplace was potentially much higher than that measured in such controlled surveys. Further, it believed that the survey understated the likely level of confusion as it included only recent buyers of the plaintiff's product who were far more likely to be familiar with it than those who had not bought the plaintiff's product. However, there was no finding that the term \"Electro-Reflexologist\" was associated with the plaintiff by those surveyed.\n27 The plaintiff also commissioned Commercial Investigations, a firm of licensed private investigators, to check on the defendant's activities. The operations manager, Philip Tan See Wei (\"Philip\"), testified that five assignments were undertaken by the private investigators between 11 January 2004 and 19 May 2004 and a report was submitted to the plaintiff on each of them. Video recording of the defendant's commercial activities was also done.\n28 The private investigators reported that the defendant had a stall selling health equipment next to the information counter at the atrium of Sim Lim Square. He had a large, coloured poster next to the stall with the words \"OTC BODYCARE\" printed at two corners of the poster. There were also boxes of the product in issue with the words \"ELECTRO-RELAXOLOGIST\". The defendant also gave out photocopies of the flyer described earlier.\n29 On most occasions, the stall was manned by the defendant's sales staff, one of whom was known as Celia. On one occasion, Celia told one of the private investigators that the defendant's goods were \"like OTO\". Philip stated that Celia also said that \"the name is the same but cheaper\". However, when the video clip taken of that conversation was examined, it did not bear this out.\n30 The private investigators also visited the defendant's premises at Chinatown Point. The glass front of the shop there was stacked up with the defendant's goods. Three large, coloured posters with the words \"OTC BODYCARE HEALTH & BEAUTY\" were placed at the top of the glass front.\n31 By 12 February 2004, the poster at the stall in Sim Lim Square had the letters \"OTC\" blacked out although it still contained the name \"ELECTRO-RELAXOLOGIST\". One of the defendant's sales staff (Ivan) informed the private investigators that the products were imported and each shipment contained 800 units. Another employee (Patrick) commented that the defendant's product \"beat the plaintiff's\" and was better in terms of value for money. The private investigator purchased one unit for $250. The receipt was issued in the name of Blackgold Asia Pacific Chinatown Point.\n32 A visit to the premises at Chinatown Point on 18 February 2004 showed that the large posters had been removed although the glass front was still stacked up with boxes. When the defendant was leaving the premises, the private investigator spoke with him on the pretext of making enquiries. He was told by the defendant to make further enquiries at Sim Lim Square and that \"if you go upstairs to the third floor, they will sell you more expensive\".\n33 Another visit to the Chinatown Point premises on 20 February 2004 showed that paper had been pasted over the words \"ELECTRO-RELAXOLOGIST\" on the boxes.\n34 On 16 April 2004, the defendant's stall at Sim Lim Square was still selling the product but some boxes had \"RELAXOLOGIST\" cut out while others had the term \"ELECTRO-RELAXOLOGIST\" cut out. The defendant's sales staff explained that that was done because the defendant had received legal notices from the plaintiff's solicitors. The cash sales receipts now had the name JIT Engineering Services.\n35 Ivan testified that he was a sales supervisor in the defendant's employment from March 2003 until December 2004. He was paid $1,200 and a sales commission every month. He helped the defendant sell different kinds of goods at various locations. Around mid-2003, he was stationed in Sim Lim Square selling ink cartridges and massage equipment imported from China.\n36 In December 2003, the defendant told him he was importing an electronic foot massager which was \"almost similar\" to OTO's. The defendant also showed him a banner and flyers which he had prepared in his laptop computer. Ivan pointed out that the defendant's logo was similar to the plaintiff's trademark and expressed his concern that the defendant might get into trouble because of that. However, the defendant brushed aside his concern.\n37 When the goods arrived from China in December 2003, both of them discussed the pricing and decided to sell them at $338 per unit since the plaintiff was selling its massage machines at $388 per unit. The flyers were distributed at the escalators of Sim Lim Square.\n38 From the beginning of their \"road show\" sales method, potential customers would invariably ask whether the defendant's product was the same as OTO's. The defendant's product used the brand \"HL\" which stood for \"Healthy Life\". None of the defendant's employees said that the product they were selling was from OTO. However, Ivan and Patrick would occasionally pun on the word \"OTO\" by showing the machine's remote control and saying that the machine they were selling was \"auto\" (automatic).\n39 One day in January 2004, the defendant telephoned Ivan. Sounding very panicky, he instructed Ivan to take down the \"OTC BODYCARE\" posters and destroy them. He also told Ivan to hide the stocks of the massage machine. Ivan and Patrick then moved the stocks to a location outside the atrium.\n40 Later that day, the defendant went to the stall and said that they could resume selling the product. However, the price was lowered to $168 per unit. If four units were purchased, the price was discounted to $138 per unit. Sales of the defendant's product rose. Potential customers asked why OTO's machine was so much more expensive that the defendant's. Ivan's response was that the defendant's machine provided better value for money.\n41 After this action was commenced, the words \"ELECTRO-RELAXOLOGIST\" were cut out from the boxes containing the massage machine. The defendant also made arrangements with his friend, Ryan Lim (\"Ryan\"), of JIT to have the receipts for sales of the machines made out in the name of JIT. The receipts were also rubber-stamped to state that there was no passing off of the defendant's goods as those of OTO. The defendant stopped going to Sim Lim Square during office hours. Ivan communicated regularly with him by mobile phone and also went regularly to the defendant's home in Pearl Bank apartments to hand over to him the money from the sales of the massage machine and ink cartridges. When Ivan asked him about the need to use JIT's name, the defendant explained that he wanted to use this to claim damages from the plaintiff subsequently. The defendant also commented that every sale he made was one sale less for the plaintiff. Ivan did not receive any salary from Ryan. The defendant continued to pay Ivan his salary in cash.\n42 The first shipment of the defendant's machine in December 2003 was for 800 units. In mid-2004, another 900 units were brought in. Ivan believed there was a third shipment of 1,000 units but he was not certain about this. Subsequently, the defendant changed the brand to \"OEM\".\n43 After a hearing in court to commit the defendant for contempt in these proceedings in September 2004, the defendant prepared a laminated certificate-like document which stated:\nNotice of Agreement\nIt has been agreed by OTO Bodycare Pte Ltd that Hiew Keat Foong (HKF) is now allowed to sell and distribute electrical foot massage and reflexological apparatus, with terms, performance and costs agreeable to both.*\nGranted Dealer Status\nby Hiew Keat Foong\n*Settlement of Notice of Motion No 43 of 2004\/C\nHigh Court of the Republic of Singapore\nDated 21 September 2004\nAn \"authorised signature\" appeared on the bottom left corner while the bottom right corner of the document had a company stamp showing Infinitus Pleasures Pte Ltd, its address and contact numbers with a seal affixed next to it. The words \"Notice of Agreement\" were prominently set out at the top in large print. The words \"Granted Dealer Status by Hiew Keat Foong\" were also in large print although slightly smaller than that of the \"Notice of Agreement\".\n44 The defendant brought three copies of this document to Sim Lim Square and gave one to Patrick (who was doing outdoor sales at that time), one to another salesman and the final copy to Ivan for him to display on a table near the information counter together with the defendant's massage machine.\n45 The defendant told Ivan he had fallen out with Ryan and would thenceforth operate through another company called Infinitus Pleasures Pte Ltd. The defendant explained that the name \"Infinitus\" was chosen because it was the name of the law firm of the plaintiff's counsel and he intended to use that company to sell silicone brassieres in order to annoy the said counsel and to challenge him to take action against him.\n46 In late 2004, the defendant asked Ivan, to the point of begging him, to sign urgently on sales receipts to show that an additional 300 units of the massage machine were sold in February 2004. Ivan refused to do so as that would have been tantamount to falsification of evidence. He asked the defendant for one night to think it over. That night, he telephoned the defendant and asked for $75,000 in return for doing what was requested of him. This was the way of escape for Ivan as he knew that the defendant would not be able to pay him that amount of money. His telephone calls were taped by the defendant. He denied that he was pressurizing the defendant to buy him over as a witness, failing which he would testify for the plaintiff for reward, as he was aware that doing such things would land him in trouble with the law. The defendant did not accept his demand for $75,000. The following day, he told Ivan the problem had been fixed. Ivan did not enquire further on what he meant by that remark. A few days later, Ivan, a bankrupt, asked the defendant for $75,000 again or he would testify against him. He claimed that it was just to start an argument and create an excuse for him to leave the defendant, which he did soon thereafter. He denied that he was telling lies in court in order to sabotage the defendant's case.\n47 Some time later, Ivan decided to contact the plaintiff's solicitors because he needed to speak the truth. He had met them on two earlier occasions when they wanted him and Patrick to testify for the plaintiff by speaking the truth.\n48 Patrick, also known as \"Ah Tee\", was a part-time salesman of the defendant in 2004. He worked closely with Ivan in selling the defendant's massage machines imported from China. He adopted everything that Ivan said in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief except for the contention that the defendant had requested Ivan to issue false receipts, of which he had no knowledge.\n49 Patrick said that when people approached them and asked whether the massage machine they were selling was an OTO product, they would say that it was not, that it was their new, second generation machine, that it had infra red footpads and a liquid crystal display (\"LCD\") screen, was cheaper and there was a warranty for one year. Their machine was therefore worth buying. The defendant instructed him to sell their machine as something different from the OTO machine and he did so. No customer had returned to claim that he thought he had bought an OTO machine.\n50 In August 2004, Ivan and Patrick went to meet the plaintiff's solicitors after Ivan told him that they were looking for both of them. The plaintiff's solicitors wanted them to speak the truth and to testify for the plaintiff. They left without promising that they would be witnesses for the plaintiff as they might lose their jobs with the defendant if they agreed to do so. Later that same month, they met the plaintiff's solicitors again. The solicitors wanted them to testify for the plaintiff and they subsequently agreed to do so. No money was promised or paid to them by anyone.\n51 When the defendant stopped selling his machine with effect from 5 March 2004, Ivan and Patrick continued to sell the same under Ryan of JIT. Ryan would bring the stocks for them to sell. Between March and August 2004, Patrick handed over to Ivan all sales proceeds and received his salary from Ivan. Patrick treated the defendant as his employer and Ryan as a friend. When Patrick's wife had a fall and he wanted to take leave from work, he asked Ivan about it. A few days later, Ivan told Patrick that the defendant said that Patrick did not need to go to work anymore as he was fired.\n52 Patrick said that Ivan told him he (Ivan) had asked the defendant for $75,000. Patrick did not know the reason for asking for the money. Patrick had no grudge against the defendant.\nThe case for the defendant\n\n53 The sole witness for the defence was the defendant. Describing himself as a trader, the defendant said he first got to know about the HL1016 machine during the Guangzhou Trade Fair in April 2003. He placed the first order for that machine in October 2003 as he saw its commercial potential. The first shipment arrived in December 2003 and he started selling the machine here in January 2004. Although another Singapore company, Gnee Hong Co Pte Ltd, had ordered a batch of the machine before the defendant's order, the Chinese manufacturer arranged to have his order shipped here first.\n54 The defendant denied having infringed the plaintiff's trademark in so far as it claimed that \"OTO Bodycare\" was its trademark. In February 2004, the plaintiff commenced this action against him and on 5 March 2004, he stopped his business of selling the HL1016 machine. That same day, the plaintiff submitted its application to register \"OTO Bodycare\" as its trademark. Because of the defendant's objection, the plaintiff's application was held in abeyance by the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (\"IPOS\"). The defendant's earlier application to register \"OTC Bodycare\" as his trademark was rejected due to the plaintiff's objection.\n55 The defendant asserted that he had a different sales concept from the plaintiff's marketing strategy. While the plaintiff's primary sales method was through its specialty store under the OTO Bodycare mark, the defendant sold his machines primarily in the atrium of Sim Lim Square in a road show style by displaying them and allowing potential customers to try them out. His sales personnel would be there to explain the functions of the machine and they would emphasise its better features and lower price.\n56 The get-up of his machine was also different from the plaintiff's. Unlike his HL1016 machine, the plaintiff's ER839 machine did not have an LCD screen and infra-red features. His machine had an eye-catching infra-red section on its footpads. It was in trapezium shape while the plaintiff's was in a rectangular box shape. It also had the words \"Healthy Life\" at the front bottom and its packaging had a different Caucasian lady.\n57 The plaintiff's machine retailed at $398 per unit while the defendant's was sold at $338 per unit in early January 2004 and then at between $138 and $168 per unit, depending on the package and the promotion on site. He stated that he was selling it presently at $99 per unit (with gifts included as a package). Since both the plaintiff's and the defendant's machines benefited users through the use of electrical impulses to massage reflexology points of the feet, the one factor that would appeal to customers would be the price.\n58 In his advertisements in the newspapers, the defendant referred to his machine as \"HL\" and not \"Electro-Relaxologist\" or \"OTC Bodycare Japan\". With effect from 19 January 2004, \"OTC Bodycare Japan\" were blocked out or removed from the posters at Sim Lim Square. After having been served the injunction in February 2004, he arranged to have the words \"Electro-Relaxologist\" removed from the packaging of the HL1016 machine.\n59 Where the allegation of passing off was concerned, the defendant claimed that the term \"Electro-Reflexologist\" was descriptive of the plaintiff's machine in terms of purpose or use. It suggested that the machine worked on electricity and was based on principles of reflexology. The plaintiff's advertisements focused on its \"OTO Bodycare\" mark and not on \"Electro-Reflexologist\". Further, the plaintiff did not have an exclusive product design here and in Malaysia. There were other brands of such machines using an identical design, such as Omico and Isukoshi.\n60 The defendant also said that his sales and marketing method did not represent his machine as the plaintiff's. Indeed, his sales staff took pains to differentiate the two machines by emphasising the superior features and better price of the HL1016. In marketing his machine, he relied on the \"HL\" or \"Healthy Life\" name and not the term \"Electro-Relaxologist\". His customers referred to his machine as foot massager most of the time. In any event, after the injunction was served on him, he removed that term from the original packaging which was from the Chinese manufacturer called Yingzhijian Electronic Produce Manufactory.\n61 Even if there had been misrepresentation in the sale and marketing of the defendant's machine, no damage was caused to the plaintiff as its sales of its ER839 machine increased from 50,000 in December 2003 to 70,000 in January 2004 and then to 100,000 in March 2004. There was no evidence to prove that the direct cause of a loss of sale of the ER839 machine was the sale of the defendant's machine.\n62 When the plaintiff applied for the injunction against the defendant, it failed to disclose the first private investigators' report to the court. That report would have shown that his sales staff differentiated the HL1016 machine from the ER839 machine. At the committal hearing against him and Ryan on 20 and 21 September 2004, the judge interpreted the injunction as stating that anyone could sell the HL machine so long as it was not sold in a way that infringed the plaintiff's rights. While the injunction prevented him from using \"OTO\" and \"Electro-Reflexologist\" and restrained him from passing off, it did not restrain him from selling his machine. As the plaintiff's solicitors disagreed with this interpretation by the defendant's solicitors, the defendant decided to stop selling the machine on 5 March 2004.\n63 He had a counterclaim against the plaintiff based on a contract dated 15 December 2003 that he had signed with the Chinese manufacturer. That contract appointed him as the exclusive distributor of the HL1016 machine for Singapore and he was obliged to order a total of 3,000 units of it every month for sale here. In January 2004, he ordered a second batch of 3,000 units but had to cancel that order after the plaintiff commenced this action and obtained the injunction in February 2004. As a result of the plaintiff's \"incessant and stubborn pressure\", the defendant had to stop selling the machine and was thus in breach of contract. He managed to persuade the Chinese manufacturer to suspend performance of their contract for some time but the Chinese manufacturer eventually chose to sell the machine to others who imported it here for sale. As a result of this, the defendant claimed he suffered losses as the machine was selling well. His solicitors informed the plaintiff's solicitors of the cessation of sale of his HL1016 machine with effect from 5 March 2004 and that he would hold the plaintiff liable for his losses pursuant to its undertaking as to damages.\n64 Responding to the plaintiff's allegations of wholesale copying of its instruction manual, the defendant pointed out that his instruction manual used the traditional Chinese script while the plaintiff's used the simplified one. The contents would be similar or identical as both of them described the operation and the health benefits of using the respective machines. In any event, the instruction manual would be read only after a purchase had been made. The plaintiff's claim was also not about copyright infringement. The packaging and the instruction manual were prepared by the Chinese manufacturer which had patent and design rights for the HL1016 machine.\n65 After the defendant stopped the use of flyers in early January 2004, he advertised his machine for sale in the newspapers, promoting it under the name \"Healthy Life\" or \"HL\". He had instructed his sales staff to sell the product as it was and not to misrepresent it as some other brand. During the launch of the product in Sim Lim Square, he was present most of the time and could therefore observe how his sales staff promoted and sold the HL1016 machine. They did not pass it off as the plaintiff's ER839.\n66 The defendant conducted the sales at the Chinatown Point outlet. There was no need to pass off the defendant's machine for that of the plaintiff's as the former had features not found in the latter and was also cheaper to purchase.\n67 After the defendant stopped selling the machine with effect from 5 March 2004, the plaintiff alleged that Ryan, an independent businessman, was the defendant's agent and was in collusion with the defendant to circumvent the injunction. Ryan had affirmed an affidavit explaining that he was selling the HL1016 as part of his own business and that he had obtained the HL machines through an importer here.\n68 At the committal hearing on 20 and 21 September 2004, there were negotiations between the parties. The stumbling block to a settlement was the proper interpretation of the terms of the injunction. The judge hearing the matter asked whether the parties were willing to be bound by his interpretation and they said they were willing. The judge then said that under the injunction, anyone could sell the machine but no one was to do so by infringing the plaintiff's rights.\n69 The parties' solicitors negotiated further after the judge had given his interpretation but, this time, the obstacle was the wording of the undertakings that the defendant and Ryan should give to the court.\n70 On the second day of the hearing, the judge remarked about the plaintiff's failure to make out a prima facie case for committal against the defendant and Ryan. Further negotiations followed. The parties finally agreed to settle the committal issue in exchange for the defendant's and Ryan's undertakings to the court. The defendant undertook not to deal with massage or reflexology apparatus under the name \"OTO\" or \"Electro-Reflexologist\" or pass off any such apparatus as the plaintiff's \"Electro-Reflexologist\". In the event of a breach of the undertaking, the defendant agreed to pay the plaintiff $300 per unit sold by him together with the costs and disbursements incurred on an indemnity basis. It was stated in the undertaking that the settlement was without prejudice to the issues to be tried at trial and without admitting that the defendant had sold or continued the sale of the defendant's machine under the name \"Electro-Relaxologist\" after 5 March 2004. The defendant believed that the judge's interpretation clarified the legal position that he could continue to sell his machine so long as he did not infringe the plaintiff's rights.\n71 The defendant then explained how he got his mark, \"OTC Bodycare Japan\". He wanted the acronym \"OTC\" to \"exemplify the 'over the counter' business concept\" as the \"OTC\" name or concept was popular for pharmaceutical products. It represented affordability. He came across this concept in the non-prescription drugs sold over the counter in China. The red and green colours in his logo denoted type 2 and 1 drugs. He exhibited several samples of pharmaceutical products which had \"OTC\" indicated on its packaging.\n72 In November 2003, he submitted an application to register \"OTC Bodycare Japan\" as a trademark but IPOS did not permit an application to contain the word \"Japan\". He therefore amended his application by dropping the word. The defendant pointed out that the plaintiff used to be known as IPS Enterprises Pte Ltd until 1997 (it should be 1999) when it changed its name to \"OTO Bodycare Pte Ltd\". His design was to differentiate \"OTC Bodycare\" from \"OTO\" or even \"OTO Bodycare\". Therefore, the colour scheme of his logo had the red and green colours in reverse order and he added the word \"Japan\" at the bottom to create a different visual impression. His act of attempted registration showed that he intended not to infringe the plaintiff's trademark. If IPOS did not approve his application, he would not use \"OTC Bodycare\" for the marketing of his HL1016 machine.\n73 Since IPOS did reject his application, he stopped using his logo. His sales staff removed or blocked out his logo in the poster used in Sim Lim Square. He had emphasised to them before the launch of his machine for sale here that all sales and marketing efforts must differentiate the HL1016 from the other brands. After IPOS' rejection of his application, he re-emphasised this point to his sales staff.\n74 He then adopted a different strategy to move the sales of his machine. He lowered its selling price to between $138 and $168 per unit and advertised in the newspapers, emphasising the name \"Healthy Life\" or \"HL\" and abstaining from using \"Electro-Relaxologist\" or \"OTC Bodycare Japan\".\n75 After the amended injunction was served on him, he handed over eight units of the HL1016 machine to his solicitors for them to be handed over to the plaintiff's solicitors. There was never any complaint by any of his customers about having been misled into thinking that his machine was the ER839 machine. Instead, many of them informed him that his machine was better than the plaintiff's. This was despite the plaintiff's advertisement on 9 February 2004 offering a trade-in for customers who had bought \"imitation\" machines.\n76 Although Gnee Hong Co Pte Ltd imported and sold the same HL1016 machine, the plaintiff did not take legal action against it. In the committal proceedings, a representative from that company made an affidavit in support of the plaintiff's case against the defendant and Ryan. The defendant also complained about the plaintiff's conditions imposed on his request to view the video recording of the investigations done by its private investigators. The plaintiff wanted him to pay $1,500 for transferring the video recording into a Video Compact Disc and then only with \"irrelevant portions\" edited out. He did not agree with the conditions as it was the plaintiff's duty to give discovery.\nThe decision of the court\n\n77 Section 27(2)(b) of the Trade Marks Act (Cap 332, 1999 Rev Ed) provides that a person infringes a registered trademark if, without the consent of the proprietor of the trademark, he uses in the course of trade a sign where because the sign is similar to the trademark and is used in relation to goods or services identical with or similar to those for which the trademark is registered, there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public.\n78 It was too much of a coincidence that the defendant's mark had the same first two letters as the plaintiff's trademark, a third letter that was dressed up to look remarkably like the letter \"O\" and horizontal stripes across the middle portion of the letters. The fact that the plaintiff's \"OTO\" was in italicised form while the defendant's \"OTC\" was not did not make a significant difference in the overall visual impact. Anyone looking at the defendant's mark without close scrutiny, whether due to distance or the shortness of time, would have thought that he had seen the letters \"OTO\". It did not matter that the defendant's mark had other words below it. The top three letters were in bold print and they were the ones that were distinctive and that would register immediately on the viewer. The use of what appeared to be \"OTO\" as a distinct word, with or without additional words or material, amounted to infringement in much the same way as \"VOLVO\" was held to have been infringed even though there were the additional words \"independent\" and \"specialist\" (see Aktiebolaget Volvo v Heritage (Leicester) Ltd\n[2000] FSR 253\n). The defendant's mark was therefore similar to the plaintiff's trademark \"OTO\". I should add that I found the defendant's explanation as to how he coined the name \"OTC' rather contrived in the light of all the other similarities his mark shared with the plaintiff's trademark and the unregistered mark.\n79 The plaintiff's trademark was registered for massage apparatus and the defendant's mark was used for massage apparatus, in particular, foot massager. The defendant had therefore used a sign which was similar to the plaintiff's trademark and in relation to identical goods for which the plaintiff's trademark was registered.\n80 The plaintiff had to prove only likelihood of confusion and not actual confusion. The plaintiff relied on the case of MI & M Corporation v A Mohamed Ibrahim\n[1964] MLJ 392\nwhere the court applied the test of imperfect recollection and said that, \"In the present case the test is to be applied in relation to people who are generally illiterate and who do their shopping in small dark grocers' shops where large quantities of goods are crowded in a disorderly manner\". The plaintiff submitted that the atrium of Sim Lim Square was a noisy, bustling area with many stalls and shoppers and where the majority of customers buying the massage machine were \"uncles and aunties\" (or middle-aged and elderly people), who were likely to be less educated and more likely to mistake the defendant's machine for the plaintiff's. It was argued therefore that the test mentioned in the case cited above was highly relevant for the present case.\n81 In this case, \"OTO\" is, phonetically and visually, a very simple word which the literate and illiterate could easily remember. It was certainly very much more well known than the defendant's \"OTC\". It was obviously for this reason that the defendant chose a name that could be deceptively presented to resemble \"OTO\". It did not matter whether the potential customers were well educated or not, and the atrium in Sim Lim Square could hardly be described as dark or dingy. What was important was whether they would think they saw \"OTO\" when the letters were actually \"OTC\" disguised to look like \"OTO\". An objective test should be applied here. There could be little doubt objectively that confusion was likely in the circumstances of this case. Further, it appeared that a good number of people were actually confused by the cleverly disguised word as they had to ask the sales staff whether the machine was \"OTO\". Once there was a likelihood of confusion, infringement had taken place and it did not matter that the defendant's sales staff then tried to explain that their product was not \"OTO\". In any event, the sales staff did not help much on some occasions as they were enjoying themselves by playing on the phonetic similarity between \"OTO\" and \"auto\", thereby confounding instead of expounding. It also did not matter if no sale took place because the defendant had already used someone else's trademark as a bait to bring in customers.\n82 The plaintiff therefore succeeded in its claim on infringement of its trademark, \"OTO\".\n83 The plaintiff also claimed passing off in respect of the defendant's use of the words \"OTO Bodycare\" and \"Electro-Relaxologist\", the similarities in shape, design, packaging and overall get-up between the defendant's HL1016 machine and the plaintiff's ER839 machine. The plaintiff argued that the defendant's machine was an instrument of deception and that the sales methodology of the defendant confused the public into purchasing his machine as and for the plaintiff's. Following from this, it was submitted that the removal of the word \"Electro-Relaxologist\" would not materially lessen or remove the likelihood of confusion and deception of the public if the sales methodology remained the same.\n84 To succeed in a passing-off claim, the plaintiff had to show that it had the necessary goodwill, that there was misrepresentation by the defendant and that damages were suffered as a result. The plaintiff asserted that goodwill arose from trading and could attach to trade names as well as the get up, including the form factor, of the product. Goodwill is the benefit and advantage of the good name, reputation and connection of a business. It is the attractive force which brings in custom (see Inland Revenue Commissioners v Muller & Co's Margarine Ltd\n[1901] AC 217\nat 223-224).\n85 The plaintiff changed its name to its present one in 1999. It has used the name and mark \"OTO Bodycare\" for a number of years and has advertised extensively. The defendant was aware of this name since about 2002. He had used it as one of the points of reference when designing his own mark, \"OTC Bodycare\". The plaintiff therefore had goodwill and reputation in this name and mark.\n86 Clearly, the defendant intended to copy the plaintiff's mark. The similarities were too striking to be mere coincidence. He was trying to ride on the name \"OTO\" when he inserted his mark in his posters and flyers. The inverted colour scheme was part of his ruse as some people may remember the colours without recollecting the order in which they appear. Others may view the inverted colour scheme as a variation made by the plaintiff. There was therefore misrepresentation on the part of the defendant.\n87 The evidence did not bear out the plaintiff's claim that its invented term \"Electro-Reflexologist\" was associated with the plaintiff and no one else. Placed side by side with the defendant's term, \"Electro-Relaxologist\", the similarity in spelling would obviously cause some confusion. However, it was not proved that the public, on seeing or hearing the plaintiff's term, which most people would not be able to say or spell without tripping up, would immediately conjure up an image of the plaintiff or know that it was an OTO product. I make the same comments where the shape and get up of the plaintiff's massage machine and the plaintiff's sales method were concerned. The plaintiff was not claiming it had a monopoly on the design of the massage machine or its sales methodology (which did not appear to me particularly unique in any case). The defendant's packaging box, while having similarities with the plaintiff's, nevertheless had enough visual differences to distinguish itself from the plaintiff's. The public's usual question about whether the defendant's machine was an OTO product was probably due to the fact that people were more familiar with the OTO name, which had been advertised extensively, and the fact that the defendant had used a term which looked like \"OTO\", rather than due to their instant recognition of the design and shape of the machine. I therefore found that it was not proved that the plaintiff possessed goodwill and reputation in \"Electro-Reflexologist\" or in the shape, design and sales methodology of its product although I accepted the plaintiff's arguments that the defendant was a copycat in many aspects.\n88 Accordingly, passing off occurred so long as the defendant used \"OTC\" or \"OTC Bodycare\" in the way he did. Once those terms were removed from his posters and flyers, the passing off ceased. The evidence showed that the defendant stopped using those terms by 19 January 2004. However, since the promotion period stated in the flyers ended on 21 January 2004 and people could still have been misled between 19 and 21 January 2004, I considered it fair that the later date should be the date of cessation of use by the defendant. I therefore held that there was infringement of the plaintiff's trademark and\/or passing off by the defendant in January 2004 (up to 21 January 2004).\n89 Unfortunately, however, the defendant was not contented to maintain that situation until trial. In an apparently defiant mood after the hearing of the committal proceedings in September 2004, he created the said Notice of Agreement (see [43] above). The defendant tried to explain why he prepared that notice. It was to serve two purposes, he said. The first purpose was to inform the public that he was allowed to sell his product (ie there was no restraint by injunction). This was because there were rumours in the market that no one was allowed to sell that product. The second purpose was to show that the holder of that \"certificate\" had been granted dealer status by him. If the plaintiff were to bully his sales staff by threatening legal action against them, they could rely on the certificate and point their fingers at him. Here again, I found the defendant's explanation to be contrived. Far from accomplishing those purported purposes, the said notice, when viewed objectively by a member of the public, strongly suggested that the defendant or the holder of the notice had been appointed a dealer of the plaintiff's goods and that what he was selling was therefore an \"OTO\" product. It was another manifestation of his youthful mischief and defiance and corrupted creativity. By instructing his sales staff to place that notice next to the product they were selling at Sim Lim Square and to carry it with them for their sales rounds, he revived the passing off.\n90 For this reason, while I found no infringement of trademark or passing off between 22 January 2004 and 21 September 2004, I held that there was passing off from 22 September 2004 until such time that all copies of the Notice of Agreement were withdrawn from use.\n91 In respect of the defendant's counterclaim for losses allegedly suffered by him between 5 March 2004 (the date he said he stopped all sales of his machine) and 22 September 2004 (the date he resumed selling the same), I did not accept that he suffered any damages at all and dismissed the counterclaim. It was incredible that Ryan or JIT would be willing to take over the business and be able to obtain stocks of the product almost immediately. If there were rumours flying in the market that no one was to sell the HL1016, as claimed by the defendant, then surely Ryan would have known about the rumours and made some enquiries before taking over the business. At the very least, Ryan would be curious to know why the defendant was suddenly giving up something which appeared profitable. It was equally unbelievable that Ryan would, in turn, relinquish the business and hand it back to the defendant once the committal proceedings were settled. Although Ivan's evidence should be scrutinised and treated with caution because of his attempts to extract payment from the defendant, I was persuaded he was telling the truth. His evidence and Patrick's testimony showed, without a doubt, that the defendant was still their employer after 5 March 2004 and that Ryan\/JIT was just a stand-in for the defendant. The defendant did not call Ryan as a witness to corroborate his evidence. If the reason for not doing so was that he had fallen out with Ryan, as stated by Ivan, then it was extremely strange that he was able to regain his business from Ryan with such ease and speed.\n93 Counsel for the defendant argued that the interim injunction obtained by the plaintiff should be discharged on two grounds. The first ground was that the plaintiff had failed to disclose the first private investigator's report which was already in existence at the time of application to court. That report would have shown that the defendant's sales staff differentiated the HL1016 from the plaintiff's ER839. The second ground relied on was that the plaintiff had pleaded in February 2004 that \"OTO Bodycare\" was a registered trademark and claimed that infringement thereof. That was not rectified until early 2005 by an amendment to the Statement of Claim.\n94 The plaintiff ought to have been much more careful in its pleading and in its application to court for an injunction. However, the defendant could also have applied to court to set aside or vary the injunction at an early stage. He did not. Instead of setting aside or varying the interim injunction at this very late stage, I would take into consideration the plaintiff's errors in my decision on the costs of these proceedings.\n95 Counsel for the defendant pointed out that the defendant had made an Offer to Settle dated 22 December 2004 under O 22A of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2004 Rev Ed). The first term in that Offer to Settle was that the plaintiff withdraw its trademark and passing-off claims against the defendant. Since there was no infringement or passing off for the period from 22 January 2004 to 21 September 2004, the defendant submitted that costs on an indemnity basis should be awarded to him for that period. I did not accept the defendant's argument. Firstly, the plaintiff was right not to have withdrawn its claims in respect of the two periods that I have indicated earlier. Secondly, the Offer to Settle contained several other terms such as the plaintiff having to pay costs and reasonable compensation to the defendant, which, as events have shown, were unjustifiable terms.\n96 On my findings, there was infringement and\/or passing off and an injunction should be granted to restrain the defendant from infringing the plaintiff's trademark or from passing off his product as the plaintiff's and I so ordered. I also granted judgment to the plaintiff for damages to be assessed in respect of the periods of infringement and\/or passing off. The costs of the assessment would be left to the discretion of the assistant registrar conducting it. Bearing in mind the matters in [94] above and the fact that the plaintiff had succeeded only partially in its claim, I ordered the defendant to pay the plaintiff 50% of the costs of these proceedings, excluding the assessment of damages. In para 3 of the defendant's undertaking to the court dated 21 September 2004 (in the committal proceedings), the defendant agreed to pay the plaintiff indemnity costs and disbursements incurred in connection with any breach of the said undertaking not to pass off his product for the plaintiff's. Pursuant to that undertaking, I ordered that costs be taxed on the standard basis up to 21 September 2004 and on the indemnity basis from 22 September 2004 onwards.

The Plaintiff International Factors Leasing Pte Ltd ('IFL') claims against the First and Second Defendants Tan Hock Kee (deceased) and THK Realty Pte Ltd ('THK Realty') payment of an outstanding loan and interest. The Third to Fifth Defendants, i.e Tan Hock Keng, Thng Sock Ching and Tan Ah Geok are guarantors. The loan was for $12 million and disbursed under two accounts. It was secured by mortgages over various properties.\n2. IFL then applied for summary judgment against the Defendants. At the hearing before the Assistant Registrar, judgment was ordered to be entered against all the Defendants as follows:\n(i) Interlocutory Judgment be entered against the Defendants for the principal amounts due under the loans and the guarantees and simple interests such sums to be assessed by the Registrar\n(ii) The Defendants have unconditional leave to defend the claim for compound interests\/default interests\n(iii) The Defendants have leave to apply for a stay of execution for the sums assessed to be due to IFL pending the counterclaim by way of a separate application to be supported by an affidavit that provides a quantification of the Defendants' counterclaim\n(iv) Cost of the Interlocutory Judgment shall be paid by the Defendants to IFL such cost to be reserved to the Registrar assessing the quantum of the principal and interests due to IFL\n(v) Cost of the balance claim shall be cost in the cause.\n3. At the hearing before the Assistant Registrar, two main contentions were raised by the Defendants. Firstly, the Defendants argued that IFL had claimed default interest at 18% per annum against the Defendants and such interest amounted to a penalty, relying on the Singapore Court of Appeal case of Hong Leong Finance Ltd v Tan Gin Huay & Anor\n[1999] 2 SLR 153\n. Secondly, the Defendants claimed that IFL had breached their duties as mortgagees in possession owed to the Defendants and that they had a set-off or counterclaim against IFL.\n4. IFL appealed against this decision but the Defendants did not. The appeal was heard by me on 28 June 20002 and, after hearing arguments, I allowed the appeal and granted summary judgment for certain sums. After hearing further arguments on 22 July 2002 and 17 September 2002, I maintained my decision. The Defendants then orally applied for a stay of execution and, after hearing arguments, I dismissed the application for a stay of execution. The Defendants have appealed against my decision.\nThe default interest of 18% per annum\n\n5. The terms of the loan to the First and Second Defendants are set out in a Term Loan Agreement dated 29 September 1995. Under clause 8.4, if there is a default in payment, Tan Hock Kee and THK Realty are liable to pay interest at 18% per annum ('the Default Interest'), over and above the principal sum and the usual interest payable if there was no default.\n6. Before me, the Defendants' position as stated in the written submission of Mr Hri Kumar, their Counsel, was still that the Default Interest was a penalty and hence unenforceable. The written submission also pointed out that as IFL did not adduce any evidence on the principal amount due, the Assistant Registrar gave IFL's Counsel the option of adjourning the hearing to file a further affidavit or for interlocutory judgment to be entered. As IFL opted for the latter, it was not open to IFL to complain about the Assistant Registrar's orders.\n7. Mr Sean Lim, Counsel for IFL, said that while he did select the second option, he also did subsequently apply to adduce further evidence, to which the Defendants' Counsel did not object. Accordingly, further affidavits were filed on behalf of IFL. The material affidavit is the third affidavit of Doreen Chia Lee Yoon, an Assistant Vice President of IFL. What she did was to exhibit a calculation of the sums due under each of the two accounts on the basis that the Default Interest is not applied at all by IFL.\n8. In response, Mr Kumar submitted that while he did not object to the application of IFL to adduce further evidence, he had reserved the Defendants' position. However, as regards the new calculation exhibited in Doreen Chia's third affidavit which did not include any Default Interest at all, Mr Kumar said he had no response.\n9. As IFL had been allowed to adduce further evidence in the face of no objection by Mr Kumar, even though he reserved the Defendants' position, I was of the view that Mr Kumar could no longer insist that IFL should not appeal against the Assistant Registrar's order. Furthermore, since Mr Kumar did not have any response to the new calculation, I allowed the appeal and granted IFL summary judgment for the sums based on the new calculation. This was on 28 June 2002. At the same time, I adjourned the rest of the appeal for both Counsel to consider what submissions they wished to make as to whether the interlocutory judgment should still stand in respect of the balance of IFL's claim or unconditional leave should be granted to the Defendants for that balance. I also allowed the Defendants to make an oral application for stay of execution at the adjourned hearing.\n10. However, by the time the appeal was fixed for further hearing on 22 July 2002, Mr Kumar had raised an argument in respect of the new calculation. He submitted that the new calculation showed that the Defendants had made an excess payment of about $5,800 on one occasion which was applied by IFL to pay the next interest payment due. He submitted that IFL was not entitled to do that and should have applied the excess payment towards reducing the principal whereupon all the interest calculated thereafter would be consequently reduced and hence the sums claimed, even under the new calculation, were excessive.\n11. Mr Lim's response was that the allegation of an excess payment was on the basis that no Default Interest was chargeable. If it was, then there was no excess payment. However, even if no Default Interest was chargeable, it did not follow that IFL was obliged to apply the excess towards reducing the principal. He pointed out that under the terms of the term loan, payment of principal was not allowed unless certain conditions were complied with. For example, the borrowers had to pay a pre-payment fee and give three months' prior notice in writing or pay three months' interest in lieu of such notice. Furthermore, pre-payments had to be in multiples of $100,000. These terms applied to another 'over-payment' as well, which he drew to my attention.\n12. Upon hearing this submission, Mr Kumar conceded that when payments were made, there was no intention to make any capital pre-payment but he argued that this meant that the terms relied upon regarding pre-payment by Mr Lim did not apply. Notwithstanding this concession, Mr Kumar maintained that the excess should be used to reduce the principal.\n13. In my view, if the Default Interest is not enforceable, and this resulted in some over-payments, it did not follow that the excess must be used to reduce the principal. Otherwise, that would be tantamount to effecting a capital pre-payment which, firstly, was never intended and, secondly, did not comply with the terms applicable to a capital pre-payment. If Mr Kumar was right, a borrower could easily circumvent any term on capital pre-payment by simply paying more than what was due, without paying the requisite fee and giving the requisite notice, or interest in lieu of notice. In my view, IFL had already acted reasonably and correctly by applying the excess to reduce the next interest amount due in its new calculation.\n14. However, Mr Kumar had raised another point i.e whether the borrowers should have been given interest on the excess in the interim. My tentative view was that they were not entitled to such interest and, even if they were, that was a matter for a counterclaim.\n15. I would add that the arguments about the excess being used to reduce the principal or, alternatively, earning some interest would not have resulted in a significant reduction in the monies to be paid by the Defendants, even if either of the arguments were successful. It seemed to me that the strategy of the Defendants was simply to prevent or delay IFL from obtaining judgment for any sum. Had I accepted either one of these arguments, I would nevertheless have allowed IFL to come up with another calculation showing the slightly reduced sums as a result of the successful argument and granted judgment on those reduced sums.\n16. In the circumstances, I did not rescind or vary my earlier order. As for the balance, IFL was prepared to agree that the Defendants be granted unconditional leave to defend, and I so ordered.\nAlleged breach of duty as mortgagees\n\n17. The Defendants then alleged that IFL had breached its duty as mortgagee to claim a set-off or counterclaim so as to support their oral application for a stay of execution pending the disposal of their claims against IFL. Their allegations were really in the nature of counterclaims.\n18. The First Defendant Tan Hock Kee had mortgaged properties at 538 to 556 (even numbers only) Geylang Road, Singapore ('the Properties') to IFL as security for the loan. The Properties were rented to one Wong Choi Tim ('Wong') and Chua Tiong Tiong ('Chua') for 12 months from 1 February 2000. At the end of the tenancy, Wong and Chua continued to occupy the Properties on a month to month tenancy. It was only on or about 12 June 2001 that IFL took legal possession of the Properties.\n19. The first complaint by the Defendants was that within three days of taking legal possession, IFL entered into a sale and purchase agreement dated 15 June 2001 ('the S&P Agreement') to sell the Properties to MKTV Karaoke Lounge Pte Ltd ('MKTV') for $12 million. MKTV was a company owned or controlled by Chua. Chua is also known as 'Ah Long San', a well-known illegal moneylender operating in Geylang. At the material time, he had been facing corruption charges involving members of the Singapore Police Force.\n20. The Defendants also alleged that IFL should not have entered into the S&P Agreement with MKTV when the Third Defendant Tan Hock Keng had received phone calls from property agents that they had interested buyers to purchase the Properties at around $12 million. On this point, the Defendants produced a letter dated 11 June 2001 from a company known as Lay Seong Enterprises Pte Ltd to Tan Hock Keng offering to purchase the Properties at a price of $11.8 million. The offer was valid for three weeks.\n21. The Defendants maintained their allegation even though they (including the beneficiaries of the estate of the First Defendant Tan Hock Kee) had signed a letter of consent for IFL to sell the Properties at a price of $12 million. They alleged that the name of the buyer in the letter of consent was left blank and they had assumed that the buyer would be Chua, not MKTV.\n22. The Defendants alleged that MKTV was in fact an insolvent company as its accounts showed that its liabilities far exceeded its assets. Indeed, MKTV was unable to complete the purchase within the eight weeks as envisaged under the S&P Agreement and sought an extension of time to complete by 31 December 2001. Although the Defendants consented to the extension of time, they alleged that they did not suspect that anything was amiss and, so, had insisted on late completion interest being imposed.\n23. The Defendants also suggested that IFL's entry into the S&P Agreement was suspicious and pointed out that there was a conflict of interest on the part of IFL because IFL had also agreed to furnish 100% financing to MKTV.\n24. On 18 October 2001, MKTV informed IFL that it would not proceed with the purchase. On hearing the news, Jenny Pang, who is Tan Hock Keng's assistant, allegedly asked one C K Wong of IFL why IFL was not taking legal action against MKTV and was allegedly told that MKTV only had a paid-up capital of $2. This conversation was denied by C K Wong who exhibited a search of MKTV showing it to have a paid-up capital of $400,000.\n25. The second complaint was that the S&P Agreement only provided for a deposit of $120,000 which was paid. This was only 1% of the purchase price of $12 million instead of the usual 10%. Had IFL insisted on the usual 10%, the higher sum would have further reduced the outstanding loan.\n26. The third complaint was that under the S&P Agreement, IFL had agreed to renovate the Properties for between $1 million to $1.5 million and this would have prejudiced the Defendants' ability to redeem the mortgages.\n27. The fourth complaint was that IFL had refused to use a related company of THK Realty to do the renovation works and thereby minimise the costs thereof.\n28. The fifth complaint was that IFL had failed to collect rent from MKTV who was using the Properties, even though the completion of the S&P had been extended.\n29. The sixth complaint was that IFL had failed to take steps to protect the Properties because when MKTV vacated the Properties on or about 5 November 2001, MKTV had ripped out whatever it wanted and left parts of the false ceiling dangling and there was debris left all over the place.\n30. The seventh complaint was that IFL failed to take any step to rent out the Properties or unreasonably hindered the Defendants' attempts to find a tenant. In particular, the Defendants alleged that they had secured a prospective tenant who was interested in renting the first floor of the Properties for $55,000 per month but IFL insisted that the prospective tenant renovate the Properties to IFL's specifications and the renovation must cost up to $1.15 million.\n31. The eighth complaint was in relation to the sale of 14 Lorong 15 Geylang which was also mortgaged to IFL as security. It was alleged that the manner in which IFL, through its agents, had sold the property resulted in a loss of $400,000 as there was an interested purchaser by the name of Yeo Eng Tiong who was prepared to pay more than the price at which this property was actually sold. However he was unsuccessful as he did not have a cashier's order for the deposit.\n32. In response to the Defendants' allegations, IFL pointed out that it was the Third Defendant Tan Hock Keng himself who informed IFL that Chua was interested in buying the Properties. The Defendants also knew that Chua would use one of his companies to buy the Properties and Chua wanted some renovations to be done. Accordingly, IFL had sought and obtained the Defendants' consent to the sale. As regards the omission to state the name of the buyer in the consent, IFL's contention was that the Defendants knew it would be one of Chua's companies and if the identity of the buyer was as important as the Defendants were suggesting, they would not have signed the consent form without insisting on the name of the buyer being inserted in the consent form.\n33. Indeed, IFL pointed out that the Defendants did not give any reason why it was important to them that Chua be the buyer and not one of his companies when they themselves were currently saying negative things about Chua himself.\n34. As regards the allegation that Lay Seong Enterprises Pte Ltd had allegedly made an offer of $11.8 million, IFL pointed out that Tan Hock Keng had admitted in his second affidavit, paragraph 7, that he did not communicate this offer to IFL.\n35. As regards the allegation that MKTV was a $2 company only, IFL pointed out that two of the prospective purchasers which were subsequently recommended by the Defendants, i.e Rickson Building Construction Pte Ltd and Grazza Pte Ltd, were themselves $2 companies. IFL's point was that if IFL had refused to enter into the S&P Agreement with MKTV, the Defendants would be the first to cry foul against IFL.\n36. I would add that although the Defendants said they did not suspect anything was amiss when they agreed to an extension of time being given to the purchaser to complete the sale, the letter containing their consent to the extension clearly identified MKTV as the purchaser. So much for their purported ignorance about MKTV being the purchaser. What the Defendants were interested in was that MKTV should be charged late completion interest at 10% per annum, as stated in that consent.\n37. As for suspicion arising from the fact that IFL was financing MKTV's purchase, Mr Lim pointed out that Tan Hock Keng's second affidavit, para 7, showed that he knew that IFL was financing MKTV's purchase. Mr Lim also submitted that there was no conflict in IFL financing the purchase as the Defendants had wanted the purchase to go through.\n38. When Mr Lim pointed out that the Defendants knew that IFL was financing MKTV's purchase, Mr Kumar advanced another argument. He submitted that they did not know that IFL was intending to furnish 100% financing. If there was 100% financing, then a 10% deposit, instead of 1%, could have been paid. This pertains to the second complaint about a deposit about 1% only. However, Mr Lim pointed out that in Tan Hock Keng's first affidavit, para 11, he had admitted that he knew that IFL was intending to furnish 100% financing. It seemed to me also that it did not necessarily follow that just because the intention was to obtain 100% financing, MKTV would be prepared to pay a 10% deposit especially if the deposit was to be paid first before the conditions for the 100% financing were met. On the 1% deposit, IFL said that that was all that MKTV was prepared to put up and if IFL had refused to sell unless a higher deposit was paid, it would again be the Defendants who would complain.\n39. As regards the third complaint about IFL agreeing under the S&P Agreement to renovate the Properties between $1 million to $1.5 million, IFL said that because the Properties were dilapidated and the property market was depressed, the Defendants agreed to the condition about renovation but reduced the quantum to $1 million. I would add that the consent to the S&P Agreement signed by the Defendants did mention renovation works to be done by IFL estimated to be $1 million.\n40. As regards the fourth complaint, IFL said it did not refuse to appoint contractors selected by the Defendants but simply informed them that IFL would obtain various quotations and the Defendants' contractors would be free to submit their bid.\n41. As regards the fifth complaint about IFL failing to collect rent from MKTV pending completion of the purchase, Mr Lim said that IFL had sued Chua for the rent (Chua being the tenant and MKTV being the occupant) and had obtained judgment and a Writ of Seizure & Sale on one of his properties.\n42. As regards the sixth complaint about IFL allowing the tenant\/occupant to damage the Properties, IFL said that MKTV was occupying the first floor of the Properties under the tenancy granted to Chua before IFL took legal possession. IFL was given physical possession only after the occupant had moved out by which time it was too late to stop the occupant from causing damage when it was moving out.\n43. As regards the seventh complaint about IFL not agreeing to rent out the first floor to a new tenant at the rent of $55,000 a month, IFL said that that amount was not sufficient to pay interest on the outstanding loan. IFL wanted renovations to be done for the first floors and the second floors as the latter was in a dilapidated condition. In any event, IFL had been taking active steps to sell the Properties including applying to sub-divide them.\n44. As regards the eighth complaint regarding the sale of 14 Lorong 15 Geylang, IFL gave its version as to why its agent did not accept an offer by Yeo Eng Tiong who did not have a cashier's order with him for the deposit. IFL also pointed out that Yeo was acquainted with Tan Hock Keng as both were co-directors in Pilecon Pte Ltd and Yeo was also a director in Five Star Book Binding Pte Ltd, which was Tan Hock Keng's company. Yeo was also one of two shareholders and directors of Rickson Building Construction Pte Ltd, one of the new interested purchasers with a paid up capital of $2 only. Accordingly, Yeo's evidence must be treated with caution.\n45. Mr Lim stressed that, aside from the alleged loss of $400,000 in respect of the sale of 14 Lorong 15 Geylang, the Defendants did not quantify their counterclaims although directed to do so by the Assistant Registrar. There were also other creditors who were pursuing their claims against the same Defendants or some of them. He submitted that it would be unfair to hold IFL back with a stay of execution.\n46. Mr Lim also relied on various contractual provisions to support the argument that there should be no stay:\n(a) Clause 13.3 of the Term Loan Agreement (found in Doreen Chia's first affidavit p 38) states:\n'all sums payable by the Mortgager and\/or the Borrower under this Agreement shall be paid (i) ... (ii) ... (iii) without deduction or withholding (except to the extent required by law) on account of any other amount, whether by way of set-off counterclaim or otherwise.'\n(b) A similar provision is found in clause 11 of IFL's standard Memorandum of Mortgage (found in Doreen Chia's first affidavit p 60).\n(c) A similar provision is found in clause 16 of the guarantee of the Third to Fifth Defendants:\n'16 All payments ... shall be made without set-off or counterclaim and without any deduction or withholding whatsoever.'\n47. Mr Lim drew my attention to two cases. The first is P.H. Grace Pte Ltd & Ors v American Express International Banking Corporation\n[1987] 1 MLJ 437\n. In refusing to grant a stay of execution on a judgment against guarantors, Justice L P Thean, delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, cited the judgment of Parker LJ in Continental Illinois National Bank & Trust Company v Papanicolaou (The Times July 15, 1986). Parker LJ said:\n'... Irrevocable letters of credit and bank guarantees given in circumstances such that they are the equivalent of an irrevocable letter of credit have been said to be the life blood of commerce. Thrombosis will occur if, unless fraud is involved, the Courts intervene and thereby disturb the mercantile practice of treating rights thereunder as being the equivalent of cash in hand.\nWe can see no relevant distinction between the guarantee in that case and the guarantees presently under consideration. The purpose of both was to ensure immediate payment if the principal debtor did not pay. Indeed the present cases make it the more necessary that the court should not interfere, for here the parties have specifically provided both in the loan agreement and the guarantees that payment should be made free of any set-off or counterclaim. It would defeat the whole commercial purpose of the transaction, would be out of touch with business realities and would keep the bank waiting for a payment, which both the borrowers and the guarantors intended that it should have, whilst protracted proceedings on the alleged counterclaims were litigated. We do not doubt that the court has a discretion to grant a stay but it should in our view be \"rarely if ever\" exercised, as Lord Dilhorne said in relation to claims on bills of exchange. Guarantees such as this are the equivalent of letters of credit and only in exceptional circumstances should the court exercise its power to stay execution. The fact that a counterclaim which was likely to succeed existed would not by itself be enough, as Lord Justice Buckley pointed out. It might be that the existence of such a counterclaim coupled with cogent evidence that the bank would, if paid, be unable to meet a judgment on the counterclaim would suffice, but nothing of that nature arises here. This is a simple case where no ground for granting a stay can be shown.'\n[Emphasis added.]\n48. Thean J then added (at p 442):\n'True it is that in the instant case, there is no such clause specifically providing that the payment should be made free of any set-off or counterclaim, but if one examines the passage quoted above, it would be apparent that that does not form an essential part of the ratio decidendi of that case. That it serves only to strengthen the Court of Appeal's view is clear from the preceding words on which it is predicated: \"Indeed the present cases make it the more necessary ...\". Were a stay to be granted in these circumstances, it would, in our view, make nonsense of the \"whole commercial purpose of the suretyship\" - \"you would lose your guarantor at the very moment you most need him\" (per Lord Simon in Lep Air Services Ltd. V. Rolloswin Investment Ltd at page 355). This is more so when, as in the instant case, it was not contended that the amount for which summary judgment was granted was not due.'\n49. Mr Kumar submitted that in that case our Court of Appeal was of the view that there was still a discretion whether to grant a stay of execution or not even if there was a contractual clause providing that payment should be made free of any set-off or counterclaim. However, it seemed to me that even if this were so, Parker LJ had said that the fact that a counterclaim was likely to succeed would not by itself be enough to justify a stay vis--vis guarantors and this view was implicitly adopted by our Court of Appeal. I would add that, on the facts in that case, our Court of Appeal was inclined to granting a stay vis--vis the mortgagor but the mortgagor had been wound up.\n50. The second case which Mr Lim referred to was Citibank NA v Lee Hooi Lian & Anor\n[1999] 4 SLR 469\n. In that case, Justice Goh Joon Seng dismissed a mortgagor's application for a stay of execution based on her counterclaim in view of contractual provisions similar to the ones before me. Goh J relied on Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corp v Kloeckner & Co AG [1990] 2 QB 514 and Coca Cola Financial Corp v Finsat International Ltd [1996] 2 Lloyd's Rep 274 and he did not seem to think that there was a discretion to grant a stay in view of the contractual provisions although he did not say so specifically. On the other hand, it appears that the American Express case might not have been cited to him.\n51. In the case before me, I was of the view that even if I still had a discretion to grant a stay of execution, notwithstanding the contractual provisions, I should not do so. As Parker LJ had said, the existence of a counterclaim would not by itself be enough where guarantors seek a stay. Moreover, as Mr Lim had submitted, the Defendants had not quantified the rest of their counterclaims. It seemed to me that the reason they did not do so was because the quantum of all their counterclaims would still be substantially less than IFL's claim. Thirdly, while I do not go so far as to say that there is no merit whatsoever in all of the counterclaims, the nature of many of the allegations made by the Defendants did not engender confidence in their bona fides. For example, the Defendants had complained about IFL dealing with Chua when it was Tan Hock Keng who introduced Chua to IFL. They had complained about IFL selling the Properties to MKTV when the Defendants had consented to an extension of time to complete knowing that MKTV was the purchaser. They had complained about MKTV allegedly being a $2 paid-up company when the new purchasers they had introduced were also $2 paid-up companies.\n52. As for Mr Kumar's submission that IFL still had a mortgage on the Properties and perhaps on another property as well, I was of the view that this was not a strong factor in favour of a stay of execution. It would be almost tantamount to compelling IFL to sell any property which was mortgaged to it before taking enforcement proceedings.\n53. Mr Kumar also submitted that if there was no stay, the Defendants would be made bankrupt or wound up and they would not be in a position to pursue the counterclaims. This would effectively shut out the Defendants and\/or hinder the fair prosecution of their counterclaims. Mr Kumar relied on the judgment of Justice Yong Pung How (as he then was) in Invar Realty Pte Ltd v Kenzo Tange Urtec Inc & Anor\n[1990] 3 MLJ 388\nwhere Yong J said, at p 391:\n'The Court of Appeal in Sheppards v Wilkinson recognized that a counterclaim may be used by a party as a defence to a claim in certain instances. The court stated that a defendant ought not to be shut out from defending unless it was very clear indeed that he had no case in the action under discussion. There might be either a defence to the claim which was plausible or there might be a counterclaim pure and simple. To shut out such a counterclaim would be an autocratic and violent use of O 14. The court had no power to try such a counterclaim on such an application, but, if they thought it so far plausible that it was not unreasonably possible for it to succeed if brought to trial, it ought not to be excluded. If the counterclaim was for a less sum than that claimed, then judgment might be signed, if there was no real defence, for so much of the amount of the claim as was not covered by the counterclaim. But if the counterclaim overtopped the claim and was really plausible, then the rule which had been often acted upon at chambers, of allowing the defendants to defend without conditions, was the right one. There were however circumstances which might call on the court to act differently. If it was clear that the claim must succeed and there was really no defence to it, and the plaintiffs would only be put to expense in proving their claim, then there ought to be judgment on the claim, but the matter must be so dealt with that the defendants who had a plausible counterclaim must not be injured; and that would be done by staying execution on the judgment until the counterclaim had been tried.\nThe Court of Appeal was unanimous in endorsing that the proper order must be for judgment to be entered for the plaintiffs, with a stay of execution pending trial of the counterclaim or further order. The reasoning seems clear that the claim by the plaintiffs and the counterclaim by the defendants must be taken separately. If there is no defence to a claim other than a plausible counterclaim, then judgment must be entered on the claim. To prevent injury to the defendants and to prevent an autocratic and violent use of O 14 by shutting out the defendants, a stay of execution on the judgment must be granted, pending the trial of the counterclaim or until further order. The overriding consideration is that if the claim is undisputed other than by means of a counterclaim, the claimant must not be put to the expense of proving his claim, even if no great expense would be incurred in proving that claim at a trial.'\n54. However, after that passage, Yong J also said that the principles cited in Sheppards v Wilkinson have been applied with approval in several cases, which he mentioned. One of these cases was the American Express case which I have dealt with above. As I have said, in the American Express case, the Court of Appeal was of the view that, generally speaking, a stay of execution should not be granted at least vis--vis guarantors. I did not think that the judgment of Yong J meant that, as a general rule, a stay of execution should be granted once there was a counterclaim so as to prevent an abuse of the summary judgment procedure or to avoid shutting out the counterclaim.\n55. Besides, the facts in Invar Realty were different from those before me. There, the plaintiff was a developer and the first and second defendants were the architect and civil and structural engineer respectively. There were defects in the building concerned but the second defendant had a counterclaim for its fees of about $179,000. The plaintiff admitted about $116,000 was due to the second defendant and on that basis, the second defendant sought summary judgment for the lower figure. As Yong J said, at p 389:\n'The issues on these two appeals are (1) whether the registrar was right in giving the second defendants summary judgment for $116,585.07 on their counterclaim and (2) whether the registrar was right in dismissing the plaintiffs' application to amend their defence to the counterclaim.'\n56. The argument on the first issue was whether summary judgment should be entered against the plaintiff at all in view of the plaintiff's claim and not whether there should be a stay of execution, if summary judgment was granted against the plaintiff.\n57. Each case must depend on its facts and in view of the facts before me, I declined to order a stay.\nSgd:\nWOO BIH LI\nJUDICIAL COMMISSIONER\nCopyright (c) Government of

Applicant\nGROUNDS OF DECISION\n\n[Companies]--[Schemes of arrangement]\nRe Conchubar Aromatics Ltd and another matter\n[2016] SGHC 279\n\nHigh Court -- Originating Summons Nos 153 and 154 of 2016\nAedit Abdullah JC\n29 August; 6 October 2016\n20 December 2016\nAedit Abdullah JC:\nIntroduction\n\n1 By way of Originating Summons No 153 and 154 of 2016, Conchubar Aromatics Ltd and UVM Investment Corporation (\"Conchubar\" and \"UVM\" respectively and \"the Applicants\" collectively) sought the court's leave for them to each convene a meeting of their respective creditors for the purpose of considering and approving a proposed scheme of arrangement (the \"proposed Scheme\"), pursuant to s 210 of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed). I granted leave for the Applicants to convene the said meetings on 18 March 2016. The meetings took place on 19 May 2016. On 29 August 2016, the Applicants were again before me to seek the court's approval of the proposed Scheme, as required under s 210(3AB)(c) of the Companies Act. The applications were opposed by SK Engineering and Construction Co. Ltd (\"SKEC\"), a creditor of the Applicants.\nBackground\n\n2 Conchubar was a company incorporated in the Cayman Islands on 20 August 2010. It had no underlying business and its primary asset was a six per cent shareholding in Jurong Aromatics Corporation Pte Ltd (\"JAC\") which it owned indirectly; Conchubar held 26.7 per cent of the shareholding in SK E&C Jurong Investment Pte Ltd (\"SKECJI\") which held 75 per cent of the shareholding in SK International Investment Singapore Pte Ltd (\"SKIIS\"), and SKIIS in turn held 30 per cent of the shareholding in JAC. UVM Investment Corporation was a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands on 30 September 2009. Like Conchubar, UVM had no underlying business and its primary asset was a 5.1 per cent direct shareholding in JAC.\n3 JAC was incorporated in Singapore on 30 May 2005 as a joint venture vehicle to own a project for the development, project financing, construction and operation of an integrated condensate splitter and aromatics complex on Jurong Island that would process condensate (a type of light crude oil) and produce aromatic products and oil products. Delays in the construction of the plant caused JAC substantial difficulties, and the company was put into receivership on 28 September 2015. However, construction of the plant had since completed and it was operational at the time of the hearing before me on 29 August 2016.\n4 In late 2015, Jurong Energy International Pte Ltd (\"JEI\"), a special purpose vehicle incorporated on 13 July 2015 by the founding investors of JAC, UVM and Conchubar, submitted to the receivers and managers (\"R&M\") of JAC a restructuring proposal (the \"JEI Proposal\"). Under this proposal, JEI would inject some US$550million into JAC in the form of equity, shareholder's loan and feedstock, in return for 60 per cent shareholding in JAC. The aim was that the injection of funds would enable JAC to fully repay debts which it owed to a syndicate of secured finance parties (\"the Senior Lenders\"). The Senior Lenders held share charges over some 95 per cent of JAC's shares.\n5 The Applicant's proposed Scheme was contingent upon the R&M's acceptance of the JEI Proposal. The key elements of the proposed Scheme were as follows:\n(a) If the R&M accepts the JEI Proposal, and subject to obtaining the appropriate waivers and consents, JEI will purchase the Applicants' shares in JAC. In return, the Applicants will receive JEI shares or JEI convertible bonds of the same or higher value as the Applicants' shares in JAC as will be determined by third-party valuation. The said JEI shares or JEI convertible bonds will then be distributed pari passu to the Applicants' creditors.\n(b) On the other hand, if the R&M does not accept the JEI Proposal or if one year has passed from the date of commencement of the proposed Scheme (\"the trigger event\"), whichever is earlier, a failsafe payment would kick in whereby UVM will pay US$300,000 and Conchubar will pay U$650,000 to their respective creditors on a pari passu basis. The sums are to be paid over 24 months, in four equal instalments every six months. The outstanding debt owed to the creditors will correspondingly be reduced by the amount of failsafe payments made. The failsafe payments will be guaranteed by Orient Time Capital Ltd, a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands on 6 May 2010.\n(c) Within 30 days of the trigger event, the Applicants will give notice to their respective creditors as to whether they intend to propose a new scheme. If the Applicants intend to propose a new scheme, they will have liberty to convene the respective creditors' meetings for the voting on the new scheme within 60 days. The new scheme, if successfully approved, will supersede the originally proposed scheme.\n6 Conchubar and UVM each convened a meeting of their respective creditors to vote on the proposed Scheme on 19 May 2016 (\"the Scheme Meetings\"). The voting results were as follows:\n(a) Creditors of Conchubar\nCreditor\nTotal Proof of Debts (US$)\nVote For\nVote Against\nConchubar Chemicals Ltd (\"Chemicals\")\n50,000,000.00\n65.5%\nUniversal Petrochem Corp. Ltd (\"Universal\")\n10,599,174.00\n13.9%\nEstanil Assets Ltd (\"Estanil\")\n1,150,912.00\n1.5%\nSKEC\n14,527,732.33\n19.0%\nTotal\n76,277,818.33\n81.0%\n19.0%\n(b) Creditors of UVM\nCreditor\nTotal Proof of Debts (US$)\nVote For\nVote Against\nMacNair Group Inc (\"MacNair\")\n28,000,000.00\n86.8%\nShefford Investment Holdings Ltd (\"Shefford\")\n317,651.00\n-\nEmirates Resources Inc (\"Emirates\")\n136,462.00\n0.4%\nSKEC\n4,129,333.57\n12.8%\nTotal\n32,583,446.57\n87.2%\n12.8%\n7 With respect to the creditors of Conchubar, the basis of Chemicals' claim against the company was a Corporate Guarantee Agreement dated 25 August 2010 under which Conchubar guaranteed a loan of US$50 million made by Chemicals to SKECJI, which SKECJI used to subscribe to JAC shares (see [2] above). SKECJI defaulted on the loan and on 25 August 2015, Chemicals demanded Conchubar's immediate payment of the guaranteed sum. Universal and Estanil became creditors of Conchubar when on 30 April 2015, Chemicals separately assigned to them portions of its claim against Conchubar. The claim assigned to Universal was US$10,422,000 while that to Estanil was US$1,131,673. SKEC was a judgment creditor of Conchubar.\n8 As for the creditors of UVM, the basis of MacNair's claim against the company was a loan of US$28 million which it granted to UVM for UVM's equity investment in JAC shares. In conjunction with this loan, MacNair, UVM and Bonquest Chemical Limited (\"Bonquest\") (sole shareholder of UVM) entered into a Convertible Bond Agreement (\"CBA\") dated 31 March 2011, for MacNair to subscribe for convertible bonds in UVM in the sum of US$28 million. This constituted approximately 99.82% of the issued share capital of UVM upon conversion. Further, Bonquest granted a charge to MacNair over all its rights, title and interest in Bonquest's shares in UVM. Emirates became a creditor of UVM when on 30 April 2015, MacNair assigned to it a portion (US$134,181.00) of its claim against UVM. SKEC was also a judgment creditor of UVM. The remaining creditor, Shefford, did not vote on the proposed Scheme since its proof of debts was submitted after the deadline set by the Scheme Manager, and the appointed liquidators of Shefford attended the meeting on 19 May 2016 only as an observer.\nRelevant Parties' Positions\n\n9 The Applicants urged the court to sanction the proposed Scheme as all the requirements had been met. No allegations had been made that the Scheme Meetings were improperly constituted or that the voting process was improper. The requisite statutory majority set out under s 210(3AB) of the Companies Act had been achieved, ie a majority in number representing 75 per cent in value of the creditors had voted in favour of the proposed Scheme in both cases with respect to Conchubar and UVM. The Applicants maintained that the creditors who had voted in favour of the proposed Scheme were not related to Conchubar or UVM, and that even if they were related, no discount ought to be applied to their votes. The proposed Scheme was also not a scheme which no reasonable creditor would agree to.\n10 SKEC, on the other hand, argued that all the creditors that had voted in favour of the proposed Scheme at the Scheme Meetings were related to Conchubar or UVM; Chemicals was related to Conchubar, while MacNair was related to UVM. Universal, Estanil and Emirates were also related parties by virtue that their claims against Conchubar or UVM were assigned from Chemicals or MacNair. SKEC thus urged the court to completely disregard the votes of all of the said creditors, ie to apply a discount of 100 per cent to all of their votes. Further, SKEC contended that the proposed Scheme was bad for lack of certainty and that its intended outcomes were unattainable. SKEC also alleged that the Applicants had not acted bona fide and had acted dishonestly, in engineering the voting outcome by orchestrating the assignment of portions of the debts they owed to related creditors (Chemicals and MacNair) to friendly entities in order to secure the requisites statutory majority of 75 per cent in value and 50 per cent in number during the Scheme meetings.\n11 The proposed Scheme Manager opined that it was possible that Chemicals might be related to Conchubar because they shared a common sole shareholder, Conchubar Infrastructure Fund (\"Fund\"), and also a common director, Mr Pardeep Dhir (\"Pardeep\"), who was also a director of the Fund.\n12 The R&M of JAC indicated that the JEI Proposal, in its present terms, was not acceptable to them. They were, however, prepared to consider future proposals from JEI.\n13 BNP Paribas (Singapore Branch) acted as the Security Agent of the Senior Lenders. The Security Agent noted that the proposed Scheme contemplated that the Applicants would sell their shares in JAC to JEI. However, the proposed Scheme did not specify how the sale was to be done; the Security Agent was of the view that the contemplated sale of the shares would be in breach of the terms of the relevant share charges, which it was not prepared to waive. That said, the Security Agent noted that the Applicants had stated in affidavit that the JEI Proposal was an \"ongoing process of negotiation between JEI and the R&M\", and they, like the R&M, were \"prepared to consider further proposals from JEI\".\nThe Decision\n\n14 Having considered the affidavits and arguments, I was of the view that sanction should be granted under s 210(3AB) of the Companies Act for the proposed Scheme.\n15 The burden of proving that the proposed Scheme met the requisite statutory majority set out under s 210(3AB) of the Companies Act was on the Applicants. In the present case, the requirement was, on the face of the voting results (see [6]), met. SKEC argued that all creditors other than itself that had voted at the Scheme meetings were related. It was for SKEC to prove this; he who asserts a fact must prove it. This is a basic rule of evidence that is enshrined in s 105 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed). I was, at the end, persuaded that Chemicals was indeed related to Conchubar, and MacNair and Emirates to UVM.\n16 The question, however, was in determining what the appropriate discount that should be applied to take into account the relationship was. The difficulty in applying the guidance set out by the Court of Appeal in The Royal Bank of Scotland NV (formerly known as ABN Amro Bank NV) and others v TT International Ltd and another appeal [2012] 2 SLR 213 (\"TT International\") was that unlike in that case, here we were not faced with creditors that were wholly-owned subsidiaries of Conchubar or UVM, and no valuation was given to MacNair's (and Emirates') interests in UVM's shareholding. In a situation like this, the court would need to adopt a broad brush approach in determining the appropriate discount, informed by the relationships in question and consider previous conduct of the parties. While an applicant bears the burden of proving that all statutory requirements for a proposed scheme have been met, in the face of an assertion by the applicant that no discount ought to be applied, the opposing party should bring into court evidence that supports its own case of what the appropriate discount ought to be and that rebuts the applicant's stand. In the present case, SKEC did refer me to several matters, but I was of the view that any discount to be applied was not to exceed 25 per cent of the value of the debt owed to the related creditors. Such a discount did not sufficiently tilt the balance. The requisite majority set out in s 210(3AB) of the Companies was still met in respect of the proposed Scheme for both Conchubar and UVM despite the discount.\n17 I was mindful of the stance taken by the R&M of JAC and of the Security Agent. However, I was of the view that this alone did not, in the present case, called for the sanction to be denied. In coming to this conclusion, I took into account the stance conveyed by the R&M and the Security Agent that they appreciated that the JEI Proposal was an ongoing process of negotiation and were prepared to consider further proposals from JEI.\n18 The proposed Scheme was contingent upon R&M's acceptance of JEI proposal. Neither authority nor reason dictate that a court must not sanction a proposed scheme simply because it was contingent on some events occurring or not occurring. There can be no blanket rule on when contingencies and conditions may render a scheme so uncertain or amorphous that it should not be approved. Much depends on the structure of the proposed scheme and the circumstances. Here, I was satisfied that the existence of the provisions for the failsafe payments provided sufficient clarity as to what the proposed scheme, at its minimum, would be. Such a scheme would also not be the sort that could not obtain support from any reasonable creditor or voter.\n19 As to the allegation that the Applicants had not acted bona fide and had acted dishonestly in engineering the voting outcome, I found that there was insufficient evidence pointing to such a conclusion.\nAnalysis\nGeneral principles\n\n20 In TT International, the Court of Appeal (at [80]) set out the following three requirements that a court must be satisfied of before it can sanction a scheme under s 210 of the Companies Act:\n(a) The statutory provisions have been complied with. For example, the court must be satisfied that the resolution was passed by the requisite statutory majority at a meeting of the company's creditors or members (as the case may be) duly convened and held in accordance with the court order convening the meeting.\n(b) Those who attended the meeting were fairly representative of the class of creditors or the class of members (where applicable), and that the statutory majority did not coerce the minority in order to promote interests adverse to those of the class whom the statutory majority purported to represent.\n(c) The court must be satisfied that the scheme is one which a man of business or an intelligent and honest man, being a member of the class concerned and acting in respect of his interest, would reasonably approve.\n21 In the present case, no allegations were made that the Scheme Meetings were not duly constituted, that the voting process was improper, or that there was insufficient or unfair representation of the creditors involved. The dispute was mainly in whether the creditors that had voted in favour of the proposed Scheme at the Scheme Meetings were related to the Conchubar or UVM (as the case may be) such that their votes ought to be discounted, and whether with the discount, the requisite statutory majority was still met.\nVotes from related creditors - the law\n\n22 For voting purposes, s 210(3) requires the creditors to be divided into separate classes if \"their rights are so dissimilar that they cannot sensibly consult together with a view to their common interest\": UDL Argos Engineering & Heavy Industries Co Ltd v Li Oi Lin [2001] 3 HKLRD 634 (\"UDL Argos\") at [27], as cited by the Court of Appeal in Wah Yuen Electrical Engineering Pte Ltd v Singapore Cables Manufacturers Pte Ltd [2003] 3 SLR(R) 629 (\"Wah Yuen\") at [11]. However, related party creditors do not have to vote as a separate class simply because they are related creditors, as the test for classification of the creditors is \"based on similarity or dissimilarity of legal rights against the company, not on similarity or dissimilarity of interests not derived from such legal rights\", such that \"the fact that individuals may hold divergent views based on their private interests not derived from their legal rights against the company is not a ground for calling separate meetings\": Wah Yuen at [13]; UDL Argos at [17] and [27].\n23 However, this does not mean that any private interests that related creditors may have will be ignored by the court in its determination of whether or not to sanction a proposed scheme. Quite the contrary, as noted by the Court of Appeal in TT International (at [155]), it is \"the norm for the votes of related party creditors to be discounted in light of their special interests to support a proposed scheme by virtue of their relationship to the company\".\n24 The overarching consideration of a court asked to sanction a proposed scheme is whether the proposed scheme is a fair one: Re Halley's Departmental Store Pte Ltd [1996] 1 SLR(R) 81 at [16]. Fairness requires that creditors who will be affected by the proposed scheme in similar ways (at least in so far as the enforcement of their legal rights against the company is concerned) must be afforded a proper opportunity to be present at the meeting(s) at which the proposal is to be considered and to indicate their choice by casting their votes. This is the underlying rationale behind the requirement under s 210 of the Companies Act for creditors to vote in different classes. Unanimity within each class is, however, not required for approval of the scheme, so long as the requisite statutory majority is met. The law recognises that creditors are normally the best judges of what is in their commercial interests, and that it will not be fair for the intentions of the majority who have assessed a proposed scheme as best serving their interests to be frustrated by the views of a minority which may happen to have a different commercial sense. This assumes, however, that the majority, in casting their votes, exercised independent, objective judgment with their commercial interests as creditors of the class as their primary consideration, as otherwise, their vote cannot be said to be representative of the class. I respectfully agree with and adopt the following views of Lord Millet NPJ in UDL Argos (at [25]):\nNormally the Court...regards businessmen as much better judges of what is to their commercial advantage than the Court could be. But this assumes that they are voting in what they honestly believe to be the interests of the class of which they are members. But this may not be the case if they have some private interest of their own which is not shared by other members of the class. As Adam J explained in Re Chevron (Sydney) Ltd at p.255:\n\"The true position appears to be that where the members of a class have divergent interests because some have and others have not interests in a company other than as members of the class the Court may treat the result of the voting at the meeting of the class as not necessarily representing the views of the class as such, and thus should apply with more reserve in such a case the proposition that the members of the class are better judges of what is to their commercial advantage than the Court can be. In so far as members of a class have in fact voted for a scheme not because it benefits them as members of the class but because it gives them benefits in some other capacity, their votes would of course, in a sense, not reflect the view of the class as such although they are counted for the purposes of determining whether the statutory majority has been obtained at the meeting of the class.\"\n25 Similar observations were made by the Supreme Court of New South Wales in Re Landmark Corporation Ltd [1968] 1 NSWR 759 (\"Re Landmark Corporation\"), where Street J stated (at 767) that:\n[Where] [I]t is difficult to attribute to the management of...associated Companies any motive which would differ from the motive of [the scheme company), I am of the view that their votes could have little, if any, weight when using the voting at the meeting as having probative force in establishing what is best in the interests of the class of ordinary unsecured creditors...I cannot regard the votes of [these] associated companies as indicative of the wishes of members of the class of unsecured creditors in respect of what is best to be done in the interests of that class....\nThe above observations have been endorsed by the Court of Appeal in TT International (at [159]).\n26 The court is thus mindful of the possibility that a \"related party may have been motivated by personal or special interests to disregard the interests of the class as such and vote in a self-centred manner\", and it is for this reason that \"courts have consistently attributed less weight to [their votes] when asked to exercise their discretion in favour of a scheme\": Wah Yuen at [35]; TT International at [154]. The Court of Appeal did not state what \"special interests\" encompasses, and the Applicants in the present matter urged me to define it narrowly (see [33] below). In my view, considering the underlying reasons, as outlined above, for why courts have usually attributed less weight to the votes of related creditors, \"special interests\" is not a term of art and neither should it be construed narrowly; it simply means interests that a party may have that differ from that of ordinary, independent and objective creditors of the same class that may cause that party to exercise its vote in a manner that differs from that of ordinary, independent and objective creditors of the class.\nWhether the creditors were related\nConchubar and Chemicals\n\n27 It was not disputed that Conchubar and Chemicals shared a common sole shareholder, the Fund, and a common director, Pardeep, who was also a director of the Fund. On this basis, SKEC contended that Conchubar and Chemicals were related. Conchubar denied that it was related to Chemicals. Conchubar maintained that the Fund was a holding vehicle of multiple investment companies, and that it held these investment companies in trust for various ultimate beneficial owners (\"UBOs\"). The UBOs were the sole decision makers for each of the investment companies, and they make decisions independently of each other based on their own interests. Pardeep was merely a proxy director who took instructions from them. This was supported by relevant declarations of trust and statutory declarations enclosed in the Scheme Manager's final report on the Proposed Scheme. SKEC alleged that these declarations were suspicious, but did not raise any evidence on how they were so.\n28 Further, SKEC provided two examples which it said demonstrated that Conchubar and Chemicals acted as a single entity. The first example related to Conchubar's and Chemical's investments in SKECJI, a company established by SKEC and Conchubar for the purpose of investing in JAC through SKIIS. Two clauses in the SKECJI Shareholders' Agreement (\"SKECJI SHA\") were central to SKEC's argument. The recital of the SKECJI SHA had a clause (the \"Convertible Bond Clause\") which provided as follows:\n(D) [Chemicals] is contemplated to subscribe for US$90 million aggregate principle amount of convertible bonds (the \"Convertible Bonds\") convertible into Shares.\nThe other clause in the SKECJI SHA that was relevant was clause 9.1 (\"Clause 9.1\"), which stated that:\nIn the event the Company is required, pursuant to and subject to the SKIIS Shareholders Agreement, to subscribe for additional ordinary shares of SKIIS or otherwise contribute additional capital to SKIIS, Conchubar and SKEC shall contribute to the funding requirement of the Company, up to the funding limits set forth in the SKIIS Shareholders Agreement, which are, as of the date hereof, set forth below, in proportion to their respective Investment Interest to enable to Company to comply with the requirements under the SKIIS Shareholders Agreement.\nName of Shareholder Total funding limit\nConchubar US$99,000,000\nSKEC US$24,750,000\n29 SKEC argued that Clause 9.1 imposed on Conchubar an obligation to provide funding of up to US$99 million. However, Conchubar paid only US$9 million, and the remaining US$90 million was paid by Chemicals pursuant to the Convertible Bond Clause. SKEC submitted that it was not merely coincidental that the US$9 million that Conchubar paid and the value of bond subscription by Chemicals pursuant to the Convertible Bond Clause added up to exactly US$99 million, which was what Chonchubar was obliged to pay pursuant to Clause 9.1; the SKECJI was deliberately structured in this manner, with the intention that shortfalls in Conchubar's payment obligations would be made good by Chemicals by way of convertible bond subscription. This, SKEC concluded, showed that Chemicals had treated Conchubar's promised investment of US$90 million as constituting its own investment in SKECJI, and that the two companies were therefore acting as a single entity. Conchubar disagreed. Conchubar pointed out, rightly in my view, that under Clause 9.1, Conchubar was not obliged to contribute US$99 million; that amount was merely a funding limit. Chemicals had subscribed to the convertible bonds as a separate investor of SKECJI, and the US$90 million it contributed through the subscription was not related to Conchubar's funding obligation under Clause 9.1. There was no clear evidence that the amounts stated in the Convertible Bond Clause and Clause 9.1 were linked, and I was not persuaded that Chemicals' subscription to the convertible bonds, without more, showed that it had treated Conchubar's investment obligations as its own. However, I took the circumstances here into account in my overall assessment of whether Conchubar and Chemicals were related.\n30 The second example of how, according to SKEC, Conchubar and Chemicals had acted as a single entity related to a deed (the \"Deed\") that SKEC and Conchubar entered into pursuant to the SKECJI SHA. Under the Convertible Bond Clause of the SKECJI SHA, it was contemplated that Chemicals would subscribe for US$90 million of convertible bonds. According to SKEC, by the time that the Deed was entered into, Chemicals had only paid US$21.5 million of the US$90 million. SKEC said that under the Deed, SKEC agreed to pay Conchubar's portion of its funding obligations to SKECJI in exchange for Conchubar's assurance that Chemicals would diligently fulfil its remaining payment obligations to SKECJI, and that this showed that Conchubar and Chemicals had conducted themselves as a de facto single entity. Conchubar denied that it had ever made such assurances.\n31 It was true that the Deed did not expressly state that Conchubar assured SKEC that Chemicals would diligently fulfil its payment obligations to SKECJI. But I found that the Deed did contain several provisions which stated that SKEC would fulfil certain payment obligations of Conchubar and\/or waive its rights and remedies against Conchubar should Conchubar fail to satisfy its obligations under the SKECJI SHA, provided that Chemicals was not in default of its payment obligations to SKECJI. In other words, if Chemicals fulfils its obligations, Conchubar gets some benefits. Some of the provisions are reproduced below:\n4. Provided always that [Chemicals] is not in default [its obligation to subscribe to the convertible bonds pursuant to the SKECJI SHA], SKEC undertakes that (a): SKEC shall not regard any non-satisfaction of the Payment Obligations on the part of Conchubar as a breach of the [SKECJI SHA] and SKEC waives all rights and remedies against Conchubar in all such respect...\n5. The parties acknowledge that the Payment Obligations may require Conchubar to provide funding...towards the procurement and issuance of Acceptable Credit Support and that such Acceptable Credit Support may be provided in the form of a standby letter of credit (\"Standby Letter of Credit\"). SKEC shall be responsible for Conchubar's portion of the Standby letter of Credit provided that Conchubar Chemicals is not in default of [its obligation to subscribe to the convertible bonds pursuant to the SKECJI SHA]...\n32 The inclusion of the above provisions in the Deed was reasonably expected to have been the result of a negotiated outcome between the parties. This, together with the other circumstances set out above (see [27] and [29] above), suggested to me that there was some kind of relationship between Conchubar and Chemicals.\n33 Conchubar argued that even if the court accepted SKEC's allegations that Chemicals and Conchuar had a close relationship, this did not axiomatically mean that Chemicals was a related party creditor. An argument was made that although the Court of Appeal in TT International did not define the kind of \"special interest\" that a creditor must have in the scheme company in order to be considered a related party creditor, it ought to be limited to the specific situation where the creditor and the scheme company are related by way of shareholding. I rejected this argument, given my views as expressed in [26] above that the term \"special interests\" was not to be construed narrowly. I found that Chemicals was related to Conchubar and that accordingly, a discount ought to be applied to the votes casted by Chemicals at Conchubar's Scheme Meeting.\nConchubar and Universal, and Conchubar and Estanil\n\n34 SKEC contended that as Chemicals was related to Conchubar, and since Chemicals had assigned portions of its claim against Conchubar to Universal and Estanil, both Universal and Estanil were also related creditors to Conchubar. I was not so persuaded. The bases on which SKEC argued that Chemicals was related to Conchubar were that (a) Chemicals and Conchubar shared a common sole shareholder and a common director; and (b) Chemicals and Conchubar had acted as a single entity on at least two occasions (see above). No allegations had been made that like Chemicals, Universal and Estanil shared similar linkages with Conchubar. Such linkages were not established by the mere assignment of portions of Chemicals' claim against Conchubar (which arose from a separate Corporate Guarantee Agreement under which Conchubar guaranteed a loan made by Chemicals to SKECJI: see [7] above) to Universal and Estanil. I therefore found that there was insufficient evidence that Universal and Estanil were related to Conchubar.\nUVM and MacNair\n\n35 The basis of MacNair's claim against UVM was a loan of US$28 million (see [8] above). In conjunction with this loan, MacNair, UVM and Bonquest entered into the CBA under which MacNair may convert the debt owed to it by UVM into shares constituting 99.82 per cent of UVM's share capital. The sum was also secured by a share charge executed by Bonquest over its shares in UVM. SKEC submitted, and I accepted, that MacNair was a related creditor of UVM by virtue of the security in the form of the share charge that it held over shares in UVM. The present situation was similar to that in TT International. In that case, a shareholder of the scheme company, as well as a bank which had provided banking facilities to the scheme company secured by shares in the scheme company, were both considered by the Court of Appeal as related creditors.\nUVM and Emirates\n\n36 Emirates became a creditor of UVM when MacNair assigned to it a portion of its claim against UVM. To the extent of that assignment, Emirates, like MacNair (see above), might convert the debt owed to it by UVM into shares of UVM, and the debt was also covered by the share charge executed by Bonquest over its UVM shares. By the same reasoning as above, Emirates, like MacNair, was also a related creditor of UVM.\nThe discount to be applied to the votes of the related creditors\n\n37 Having determined that Chemicals, MacNair and Emirates were related creditors, the next question was whether and to what extent their votes at the Scheme Meetings should be discounted. The Applicants and SKEC chose to adopt extreme positions, with the Applicants maintaining that no discount at all ought to be applied and SKEC contending that a 100 per cent discount was appropriate. I was not persuaded by either argument.\n38 In TT International, the Court of Appeal held that where a related creditor was a wholly-owned subsidiary of the scheme company, its votes ought to be wholly discounted, ie a 100 per cent discount was to be applied: see [158] of the judgment. Where a related creditor was a shareholder of the scheme company or held as security shares of the scheme company, then the votes of that creditor could be discounted by the value of the scheme company's shares that was owned or held as security by the related creditor, as ascertained on the date when the scheme documents were dispatched to the creditors (the \"ascertainment date\"): see [170] of judgment read with [17].\n39 The difficulty in applying the guidance set out in TT International in this case was that here, we were not faced with creditors that were wholly-owned subsidiaries of Conchubar or UVM, and no valuation could be given to MacNair's and Emirates' interests in UVM's shareholding as at the ascertainment date. UVM said that as at the ascertainment date, it was insolvent. It had no underlying businesses and its primary asset was in the JAC shares which had been pledged to the Senior Lenders and thus could not be unilaterally disposed of. Hence, UVM argued, that from the point of view of its shareholders, its shares must be of zero value. Accordingly, the value of the alleged interest of MacNair and Emirates in UVM would correspondingly be zero in value, and the discount on their votes would be zero as well. I was not convinced that the value of UVM's shares from the perspective of the shareholders (or of MacNair and Emirates) must be zero. As pointed out by SKEC, although JAC was in receivership, it had recently began operations and there was a prospect that it might become profitable. This would translate to an increase in value of UVM's shares. I acknowledged that valuation of UVM's shares might not be an easy task, but this certainly did not mean that a zero value should be attributed to the shares.\n40 It was to me clear that Chemicals, MacNair and Emirates were related to the Applicants, and some discount had to be applied to their votes at the Scheme Meeting to take that into account, despite the difficulties in ascertaining the specific discount. In a situation such as the present, the court remained guided by general principles. At [26] above, it is stated that the reason why \"courts have consistently attributed less weight\" to the votes of related credits was because of the possibility that that a \"related party may have been motivated by personal or special interests to disregard the interests of the class as such and vote in a self-centred manner\". Hence, in determining what the appropriate discount ought to be in a given case, the overarching question is to what extent a related creditor's voting decision was influenced by its relationship to the scheme company, such that it was not able to exercise its decision independently as an objective member of the class of creditors. In extreme cases where the related creditor was entirely controlled by the scheme company (such as where the creditor was a wholly-owned subsidiary of the scheme company), it would be clear that their interests would be wholly aligned with that of the scheme company, such that their votes at the scheme meetings could not have any probative value in establishing the wishes of members of the class of creditors in respect of what was best to be done in the interests of that class, and accordingly must be wholly discounted: see TT International at [158] and Re Landmark Corporation, as cited at [25] above. But outside of these extreme cases, relationships between related creditors and the scheme companies may be complex and the court will not in these cases be able to determine with scientific precision what the appropriate discount ought to be. Instead, the court needs to adopt a broad-brushed approach, informed by the relationships in question and consider previous conduct of the parties. Such was the approach that had to be taken in the present case.\n41 The applicant under s 210 of the Companies Act bears the burden of proving that all statutory requirements for a proposed scheme have been met. However, in the face of an assertion by an applicant that no discount ought to be applied, the party that asserts otherwise should bring into court evidence that supports its own case and that rebuts the applicant's stand. SKEC did refer me to several matters demonstrating the extent of the relationship between the creditors and the Applicants (see [27] - [36] above), but I was of the view that any discount to be applied was not to exceed 25 per cent of the value of the debt owed to the related creditors, in each case with respect to Conchubar and UVM. Such a discount did not sufficiently tilt the balance. The requisite majority set out in s 210(3AB) of the Companies was still met in respect of the proposed Scheme for both Conchubar and UVM despite the discount.\nWhether the proposed Scheme was bad for being a contingent scheme or for uncertainty\n\n42 SKEC argued that the intended outcomes of the proposed Scheme was unattainable as it was doomed for failure, because it was contingent upon the acceptance of the JEI Proposal by the R&M of JAC, and the R&M had already indicated that the JEI Proposal was not acceptable (see [12] above). Further, the proposed Scheme contemplated the transfer of the Applicants' interests in JAC to JEI, but the Security Agent had expressed the view that this would be in breach of the terms of relevant share charges, which it was not prepared to waive (see [13] above). SKEC then took issue with clause 2.3 (\"Clause 2.3\") of the proposed Scheme, which provided as follows:\nWithin 30 days of the earlier of (i) one (1) year from the date of this Scheme and (ii) the date that the [Applicants] receives notice from JEI that the [JEI Proposal] had been rejected by the Receivers (the \"Expiry Date\"), the [Applicants] shall give notice to the Eligible Creditors as to whether it intends to propose a new Scheme. If the [Companies] intend to propose a new Scheme, it shall have the liberty to convene an Eligible Creditors Meeting for the Eligible Creditors to vote on the new Scheme within 60 days thereby superseding this Scheme if accepted.\nSKEC submitted that the JEI Proposal had already been unequivocally rejected by the R&M, such that if this court should sanction the proposed Scheme, then the \"Expiry Date\" defined in Clause 2.3 would immediately take effect. Clause 2.3, SKEC argued, effectively allowed the Applicants to propose new schemes and circumvent the statutory procedure under s 210(1) of the Companies Act that would necessitate a fresh application to the Court for leave to convene creditors' meetings. Further, citing the judgment of Santow J in the New South Wales case of Re NRMA Ltd [2000] NSWSC 82 (\"Re NRMA\"), SKEC submitted that the Scheme was bad for lack of certainty, as it carried within itself machinery for variation of its own terms, and did not allow the creditors or the court to see at the time the scheme was proposed what they were being asked to accept or approve. The Applicants cited the same case in support of their position that the proposed Scheme was sufficiently certain.\n43 I was mindful of the stance taken thus far by the R&M of JAC and of the Security Agent. However, I did not share the view of SKEC that the circumstances, as they presently appeared, pointed unequivocally to the intended outcomes of the proposed Scheme as being certainly unattainable and doomed for failure. The Applicants had stated in affidavit that the JEI Proposal was an \"ongoing process of negotiation between JEI and the R&M\", and both the R&M and the Security Agent had indicated that they were \"prepared to consider further proposals from JEI\" (see [12] and [13] above).\n44 As for the allegation on uncertainty, the proposed Scheme was contingent upon the R&M's acceptance of JEI proposal. Counsel for the Applicants pointed out to me that no local authority had directly addressed whether or not a court may sanction contingent schemes, but referred me to several foreign cases which I found useful to the present analysis. I respectfully adopt the following passages of Santow J in Re NRMA (at [28] and [29]):\n28. The use of conditions subsequent to bring about termination of a scheme of arrangement needs to be distinguished from a scheme containing machinery which could lead to variation of its terms. Courts will generally not approve schemes which carry within themselves machinery for variation of their own terms: see, for example, Re R M Eastmond Pty Ltd and the Companies Act (1972) 4 ACLR 801; Re Telford Inns Pty Ltd (1985) 3 ACLC 660; Re Leamon Consolidated (Vic) Pty Ltd (1985) 10 ACLR 263. The reason for that is stated in Leamon (at 265):\n\"In my opinion, a scheme ... ought not to be approved unless the creditors and the court can see very clearly at the time the scheme is proposed what it is that they are being asked to accept, and, in the case of the court, what it is that it is being asked to approve\".\n29. Clarity and certainty are thus the touchstones. Provided that clarity and certainty are present on the face of the scheme and no new decision making process intrudes after court approval, it does not matter that different results may emerge in different (but clearly identified) eventualities. A key question is whether the scheme is, according to its own terms, self-executing in the sense that certain results follow in certain defined events.\n45 Similarly, in Re Homemaker Retail Management [2001] NSWSC 1058, Barrett J said (at [17]):\nEven if the possibility of alteration has been sufficiently identified and explained, there is still a clear and firm predisposition of the court not to favour provisions allowing schemes to be changed after they have received court approval. The point was made in stark terms by Street J (as he then was) in Re R M Eastmond Pty Ltd (1972) 4 ACLR 801 at 804 :\n... No scheme compulsorily imposed under the authority of the court under s 181 should be capable of amendment by machinery internal to the scheme itself.\n46 The position is the same in the UK. In Re Lombard Medical Technologies Plc [2014] EWHC 2457 (Ch), Henderson J stated (at [26]):\nI can see no objection in principle to the court sanctioning a scheme which is conditional in one or more respects, provided always that the court considers it appropriate to do so in the exercise of its discretion. Examples of the kind of condition which the court may be willing to sanction, even if they are unsatisfied at the date of the hearing, are outstanding requirements for foreign regulatory approval which there is no reason to suppose will not be granted. Further, the terms of the scheme itself may provide that it will cease to have effect in certain circumstances, for example if the steps contemplated are not taken before a specified long-stop date. By contrast, the court would be most unlikely to sanction a scheme if the outstanding condition was one which in effect conferred on a third party the right to decide whether, or when, the scheme should come into operation, or which enabled the terms of the scheme to be varied in some material respect. The objection then would be that the court was not truly in a position to consider the merits of the scheme, so it could not properly exercise the jurisdiction conferred on it by Parliament to approve the scheme on behalf of all members of the relevant class or classes of shareholders.\n47 In my view, there was neither authority nor reason that a court must never sanction a scheme simply because it was contingent on some events occurring or not occurring. The focus of the analysis ought to be whether the scheme was sufficiently clear and certain so as to allow creditors to make an informed choice when exercising their votes: see Wah Yuen at [42], where it was stated that \"it is an independent principle of law that the creditors must be put in a position to make an informed choice\". There was no blanket rule on when contingencies and conditions may render a scheme so uncertain or amorphous that it should not be approved. Much would depend on the structure of the proposed scheme and on the specific circumstances. That said, several common principles could be distilled from the authorities cited above and they provide general guidance:\n(a) A scheme ought not to be approved unless the creditors and the court can see very clearly at the time the scheme is proposed what it is that they are being asked to accept or approve.\n(b) A scheme containing machinery which could lead to variation of its terms is to be distinguished from the use of conditions subsequent to bring about termination of a scheme of arrangement.\n(i) In the former case, courts will generally not approve schemes which carry within themselves machinery for their own terms to be changed after they have received court approval.\n(ii) In the latter case, however, a scheme may provide for different results (including termination of the scheme) to emerge from different eventualities. This alone is no reason for a court to refuse to sanction the scheme, provided that the scheme clearly sets out what kind of results would follow on the occurrence of certain clearly defined events.\n48 In the present case, I was of the view that the proposed Scheme was sufficiently clear and certain. In particular, the proposed Scheme provided for failsafe payments in the event that the R&M did not accept the JEI Proposal, or on the expiry of one year from the date of commencement of the proposed Scheme. There was thus sufficient clarity and certainty as to what the proposed Scheme, at its minimum, would be. As for Clause 2.3, it was not to be construed as providing a machinery for a third party to change the terms of the scheme; it merely provided that the Applicants might propose a new scheme and might convene a creditors' meeting to vote on that new scheme. The creditors must still accept the newly proposed scheme before it could take effect.\nWhether the proposed Scheme was one which a reasonable creditor would approve\n\n49 I was further of the view that the proposed Scheme was not one that would not obtain any support from any reasonable creditor or voter. I noted that if the proposed Scheme did not succeed, the alternative course for the creditors would be to commence liquidation proceedings against the Applicants, in which case it would be uncertain as to how much of their debts they would be able to recover. This was because the Applicants had no underlying businesses and their primary asset was their shares in JAC which were pledged to the Senior Lenders and thus could not be unilaterally disposed of. In any event, JAC had been put under receivership and the value of its shares was difficult to ascertain (see [39] above). On the other hand, under the proposed Scheme, the Applicants' creditors were, at the minimum, guaranteed the failsafe payments.\nOther allegations\n\n50 There was insufficient evidence that the Applicants had acted dishonestly in engineering the voting outcome or had not acted bona fide in making the applications.\nOrders made\n\n51 In light of the above, I granted the sanction for the proposed Scheme pursuant to s 210(3AB) of the Companies Act. Further, I ordered that:\n(a) Pursuant to section 210(10) of the Companies Act, all pending, contingent or fresh suits, actions or proceedings against the Applicants or any enforcement or execution against any of their assets shall be restrained for one year unless otherwise ordered by the court, but such restraint does not in any event bind or affect the interests of the R&M of JAC or the Security Agent;\n(b) The Applicants shall send to the court and the scheme creditors, by way of letter every two months, a status update on the progress of the approved scheme of arrangement? and\n(c) The Applicants, SKEC and any interested party shall return to Court for a status conference approximately three months from the date of the order, on a date to be fixed by the Registry.\n52 I made no order as to costs.\nLeave to appeal\n\n53 On 7 September 2016, SKEC applied, via Summons No. 4396 of 2016, for leave to appeal against my orders set out at [51] above (\"the Orders\"). I heard the parties on 6 October 2016. The situation was a unique one because it was SKEC, the intended appellant, who took the position that leave was required for it to file an appeal, while the Applicants, as the prospective respondents, were of the view that leave was not required. SKEC took the view that leave was required for it to file an appeal, pursuant to s 34(2)(d) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) (\"SCJA\"), as it regarded the Orders as interlocutory orders made at the hearing of an interlocutory application. The Applicants was of the view that the Orders were not interlocutory orders and they were not made at a hearing of an interlocutory application.\n54 In The \"Nasco Gem\" [2014] 2 SLR 63 (\"Nasco Gem\"), the Court of Appeal held (at [14]) that an interlocutory application, in the context of the SCJA, meant \"an application [that] is peripheral to the main hearing determining the outcome of the case, or [that] occurs during the course of proceedings between the initiation of the action and the final determination\". As for the question of whether an order made at the hearing of an interlocutory application was an \"interlocutory order\", an order that \"finally disposes of the rights of the parties\" was not an \"interlocutory order\": Nasco Gem at [13] - [14].\n55 I was of the view that leave to appeal was not required in the present case, as the Applicants' applications were not interlocutory applications and, in any event, the Orders were not interlocutory orders. The applications were not interlocutory in nature as they were not \"peripheral\" to any \"main hearing determining the outcome of the case\". The outcome sought by Conchubar and UVM was the court's sanction of the proposed Scheme with the accompanying moratoriums for the proposed Scheme to take effect. The applications were made to determine that very outcome. Once the applications were determined, the entire subject matter of Originating Summons No 153 and 154 of 2016 was spent and there was nothing more to proceed on. The Orders were also not interlocutory orders as they finally disposed of the rights of the parties; the Orders were made pursuant to s 210(3AB) of the Companies Act and under s 210, a court-sanctioned scheme was binding on the creditors (including SKEC), unless there was a successful appeal against the court's order sanctioning the scheme.\n56 While I was of the view that leave to appeal was not required in the present case, I would have granted leave if that was required. The decision in Originating Summons 153 and 154 of 2016 engaged unsettled questions of law such as to what extent related creditors votes ought to be discounted in determining whether the requisite statutory majority set out in s 210(3AB) of the Companies Act was met, for which further arguments and a decision by the Court of Appeal would be of public importance.\n57 As any appeal by SKEC against the Orders were now out of time, SKEC had filed an application to the Court of Appeal for an extension of time to file a notice of appeal.\nAedit Abdullah\nJudicial Commissioner\nAndy Lem,
