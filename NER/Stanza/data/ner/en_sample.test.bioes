The O
elements O

that O

39 O
These O
two O
elements O
can O
be O
dealt O
with O
briefly O

The O
answer O
to O
the O
first O
question O
is O
plain O
: O
the O
Debenture O
provided O
a O
fixed O
charge O
over O
the O
GST O
Refund O
and O
therefore O
the O
money O
had O
to O
be O
kept O
for O
the O
plaintiff O
and O
could O
not O
be O
paid O
to O
a O
third O
party O
without O
the O
plaintiff O
's O
consent O
. O
The O
plaintiff O
had O
no O
prior O
knowledge O
of O
the O
various O
payments O
made O
by O

from O
the O

and O
did O
not O

Such O

thus O
, O
in O

by O
JDD B-ORG

. E-ORG

As O
for O
the O
second O
question O
, O
the O
only O
way O
that O
the O
payment O
in O
breach O
of O
trust O
could O
be O
made O
was O
if O
they O
were O
authorised O
by O
the O

who O
were O
the O

stated O
that O
: O

Although O

the O
standard O
by O

whether O

objective O

If O
by O

his O

was O

fixed O

over O

and O
he O
knew O

On O
the O
evidence O
, O
I O
find O
that O
the O

defendant O
knew O
, O
at O
all O
material O
times O
, O
and O
definitely O
before O
the O
receipt O
by O

of O
the O
GST O

, O
that O
the O
Debenture O
covered O
all O
book O
debts O
belonging O
to O
JDD S-ORG

and O
that O
the O
same O
were O
subject O
to O
a O
fixed O
charge O
. O
As O
for O
the O
second O
defendant O
, O
he O
was O
aware O
that O
the O
Debenture O
covered O
all O
assets O
of O
JDD S-ORG

and O
, O
if O
he O
had O
taken O
advice O
in O
relation O
to O
clauses O
that O
were O
unclear O
to O
him O
as O
he O
should O
have O
, O
would O
have O
been O
informed O
and O
known O
that O
book O
debts O
formed O
part O
of O
the O
assets O
of O
JDD S-ORG

and O
were O
subject O
to O
a O
charge O
in O
favour O
of O
the O
plaintiff O
. O
61 O
The O
plaintiff O
submits O
that O
on O
the O
facts O
of O
this O
case O
there O
are O
only O
two O
possibilities O
. O
Either O
: O
( O
a O
) O
the O
defendants O
were O
well O
aware O
that O
the O
Debenture O
created O
a O
trust O
over O
the O
GST O
Refund O
in O
favour O
of O
the O
plaintiff O
and O
prevented O
them O
from O
disposing O
of O
the O

for O
purposes O
other O
than O
repaying O
the O
plaintiff O
, O
but O
proceeded O
regardless O
; O
or O
( O
b O
) O
they O
had O
good O
grounds O
to O
suspect O
that O
the O
expenditure O
was O
not O
permitted O
or O
at O
least O
that O
they O
were O
not O
permitted O
to O
freely O
dispose O
JDD B-ORG

assets O
, O
given O
that O
the O
plaintiff O
had O
security O
over O
all O
of O
JDD B-ORG

's E-ORG

assets O
, O
such O
that O
ordinary O
honest O
people O
would O
consider O
it O
to O
be O
a O
breach O
of O
standards O
of O
honest O
conduct O
if O
the O
defendants O
failed O
to O
make O
further O
adequate O
queries O
before O
disposing O
of O
the O
funds O
. O
The O
plaintiff O
further O
says O
that O
in O
both O
cases O
the O
defendants O
' O
conduct O
would O
be O
dishonest O
. O
62 O
In O
my O
view O
, O
the O
first O
defendant O
fell O
within O
the O
first O
category O
. O
However O
, O
even O
if O
this O
is O
not O
completely O
supported O
by O
the O
evidence O
, O
there O
is O
no O
doubt O
in O
my O
mind O
that O
he O
fell O
within O
the O
second O
category O
as O
well O
. O
As O
for O
the O
second O
defendant O
, O
in O
my O
judgment O
his O
failure O
( O
if O
indeed O
he O
was O
telling O
the O
truth O
) O
to O
obtain O
an O
explanation O
for O
those O
parts O
of O
the O
Debenture O
which O
he O
did O
not O
understand O
, O
was O
reckless O
. O
He O
therefore O
fell O
within O
the O
second O
category O
in O
that O
he O
had O
good O
grounds O
to O
believe O
that O
JDD S-ORG

was O
not O
able O
to O
freely O
dispose O
of O
all O
of O
its O
assets O
. O
I O
go O
on O
to O
consider O
whether O
the O
inference O
of O
dishonesty O
that O
I O
have O
drawn O
can O
be O
displaced O
by O
certain O
matters O
on O
which O
the O
defendants O
rely O
in O
answer O
to O
the O
plaintiff O
's O
case O
. O
The O
defendants O
' O
rebuttals O
63 O
The O
defendants O
have O
made O
two O
types O
of O
submissions O
as O
to O
why O
they O
should O
not O
be O
considered O
dishonest O
in O
any O
event O
. O
The O
first O
category O
is O
set O
out O
at O
[ O

[ O

is O
set O
out O
at O
[ O

above O
. O
64 O
The O
first O
category O
pertains O
to O
the O
enforceability O
of O
the O
Debenture O
and O
consists O
of O
the O
allegations O
that O
: O
( O

that O
the O
parties O
had O
agreed O
not O
to O

the O
Debenture O

and O
( O

no O

because O
of O
the O

The O
defendants O
pleaded O
that O
there O

In O

acknowledge O
inconsistencies O

the O
three O
versions O
of O
the O
collateral O

However O

they O
conceded O

that O
the O
Debenture O
was O

even O
if O
the O
Investment O
Agreement O
was O
not O
completed O

Thus O
, O
they O
expressly O
disavowed O
on O
the O
stand O
the O
purported O
collateral O
agreement O
that O
they O
had O

68 O
I O
am O
satisfied O
that O
no O
collateral O

existed O
in O

It O
would O
not O

logical O

have O
an O

enforce O
the O

both O
the O

the O

because O
the O
completion O
of O
the O

would O
have O
meant O
that O
the O

had O
been O
paid O
off O

once O
this O
happened O
there O
would O
be O
nothing O

It O
must O

this O
recognition O

impelled O
the O

when O
questioned O

to O
resile O

In O

, O
the O
defendants O
submitted O
that O
they O
were O
informed O
of O
the O
principal O
terms O
of O
the O
Assignment O

in O
December O

by O
way O
of O
a O
term O
sheet O
circulated O
by O
the O
plaintiff O

in-house O
counsel O
. O
The O
second O
defendant O
admitted O
that O
he O
had O
understood O
from O
the O
term O

that O
CPH S-ORG

was O
to O
make O
payment O
for O
the O

. O
The O
first O
defendant O
, O
after O
quite O
a O
bit O
of O
prevarication O
, O
also O
admitted O
that O
his O
understanding O
of O
the O
term O
sheet O
was O
that O
the O
assignment O
was O
to O
become O
effective O
when O
CPH S-ORG

paid O
the O
outstanding O
amount O
due O
to O
the O
plaintiff O
. O
JDD S-ORG

itself O
received O
legal O
advice O
on O
the O
Debenture O
and O
the O
first O
defendant O
was O
the O
one O
who O
was O
in O
contact O
with O
the O
lawyers O
. O
If O
he O
did O
not O
understand O
the O
terms O
, O
they O
would O
have O
explained O
the O
same O
to O
him O
. O
81 O
I O
am O
satisfied O
that O
in O
fact O
both O
defendants O
knew O
and O
understood O
that O
any O
transfer O
of O
interest O
from O
the O
plaintiff O
to O
CPH S-ORG

would O
only O
occur O
when O
CPH S-ORG

made O
payment O
of O
the O
outstanding O
amount O
of O
$ O
154,984,800.40 O
. O
They O
were O

meant O
that O
it O
was O
not O
established O
that O
the O
defendant O
intended O
to O
defraud O
the O

The O
defendant O
hoped O
, O
maybe O
expected O
, O
to O
be O
able O
to O
pay O
the O
airline O
, O
but O
the O
money O
was O
lost O
in O
the O
ordinary O
course O
of O
a O
poorly-run O
business O
with O
heavy O
overhead O
expenses O
. O
These O
facts O
are O
beside O
the O
point O
. O
The O
defendant O
had O
no O
right O
to O
employ O
the O
money O
in O
the O
business O
at O
all O
. O
That O
was O
the O
breach O
of O
trust O
. O
The O
company O
's O
inability O
to O
pay O
the O

was O
the O
consequence O
of O
that O
breach O
of O
trust O
. O
[ O
emphasis O

Honest O
belief O
84 O
The O
defendants O
also O
argue O
that O
the O
various O
expenses O
that O
JDD S-ORG

paid O
with O
funds O
from O
the O
DBS S-ORG

Account O
were O
either O
for O
the O
benefit O
of O
the O
Data O

and O
required O
to O
preserve O
the O
security O
under O
the O
Debenture O
, O
or O
were O
necessary O
for O
other O
reasons O
. O
As O
a O
general O
observation O
, O
this O
argument O
does O
not O
excuse O
the O
unauthorised O
application O
of O
funds O
. O
Where O
payments O
were O
necessary O
to O
preserve O
the O
security O
under O
the O
Debenture O
, O
the O
defendants O
could O
have O
notified O
the O
plaintiff O
of O
the O
same O
and O
obtained O
the O
plaintiff O
's O
approval O
for O
payment O
. O
It O
is O
highly O
unlikely O
that O
the O
plaintiff O
would O
have O
refused O
to O
authorise O
payment O
for O
items O
like O
property O
tax O
and O
insurance O
premiums O
. O
Where O
the O
payments O
related O
to O
JDD B-ORG

's E-ORG

other O
obligations O
, O
the O
plaintiff O
should O
still O
have O
been O
notified O
and O
if O
it O
had O
refused O
authorisation O
, O
such O
refusal O
would O
have O
had O
to O
be O
obeyed O
. O
85 O
Quite O
apart O
from O
the O
question O
of O
authority O
from O
the O
plaintiff O
, O
in O
my O
view O
, O
there O
are O
a O
number O
of O
items O
which O
an O
objective O
person O
would O
have O
realised O
had O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
the O
security O
and O
that O
the O
plaintiff O
was O
very O
likely O
to O
refuse O
to O
agree O
to O
payment O
of O
the O
same O
. O
In O
those O
cases O
especially O
, O
on O
the O
objective O
standard O
, O
the O
defendants O
were O
acting O
dishonestly O
in O
authorising O
payment O
without O
reference O
to O
the O

have O
come O

the O
conclusion O
that O

Here O
, O
it O
is O
perhaps O
possible O
to O
argue O
that O
although O
the O
defendants O
knew O
about O
the O
terms O
of O
the O
Debenture O
or O
were O
reckless O
in O
making O
the O
various O
payments O
, O
they O
did O
not O
have O
any O
intention O
of O
inducing O
a O
breach O
of O
contract O
between O
JDD S-ORG

and O
the O
plaintiff O
. O
Most O
of O
the O
payments O
were O
to O
meet O
the O
ordinary O
expenses O
of O
the O
Data O
Centre O
like O
the O
utility O
bills O
or O
so O
as O
to O
get O
CPH S-ORG

on O
board O
. O
The O
latter O
aim O
was O
to O
be O
accomplished O
by O
ensuring O
that O
no O
unfavourable O
developments O
took O
place O
during O
the O
period O
in O
which O
the O
parties O
were O
awaiting O
completion O
of O
the O
Investment O
Agreement O
. O
However O
, O
I O
think O
this O
argument O
fails O
. O
I O
have O
held O
that O
the O
defendants O
dishonestly O
assisted O
JDD S-ORG

in O
a O
breach O
of O
trust O
. O
It O
must O
follow O
that O
they O
intended O
to O
breach O
the O
terms O
of O
the O
Debenture O
when O
they O
used O
the O
plaintiff O
's O
money O
to O
pay O
third O
parties O
. O
The O
breach O
of O
contract O
here O
was O
`` O

'' O
in O
Lord O

93 O
In O
their O
defence O
, O
the O

relied O
on O

( O
`` O

The O

is O
that O

The O

94 O
Said B-PRECEDENT

was O
a O
case O
of O

formation O
. O
In O
that O
case O
, O
the O
plaintiff O
had O
obtained O
a O
ticket O
for O
a O
theatre O
play O
via O
a O
friend O

because O
he O
knew O
that O

His O

On O

the O

, O
refused O

sued O
the O
defendant O
for O
procuring O
a O
breach O
of O

him O
. O
The O
court O
held O
, O
first O
, O
that O

made O
the O
observation O

meant O
to O
`` O

'' O
[ O

. O
On O
the O
facts O

I O
held O
that O
the O

therefore O
did O
not O
apply O
to O
a O

dishonestly O
caused O

overcharge O
its O

. O
I O
should O
add O
that O
the O
facts O
in O
Nagase S-PRECEDENT

were O
quite O
different O
in O
that O
the O
defendant O
there O
was O
the O
owner O
and O
controlling O

of O
the O
company O
and O
stood O
to O
gain O
personally O
from O
his O
actions O
in O

to O
the O
company O
. O
Here O
, O
it O
is O
certainly O
arguable O
that O
, O
focussed O
as O
they O
were O
on O
achieving O
the O
continued O
existence O
of O
JDD S-ORG

through O
the O
completion O
of O
the O

, O
the O
defendants O
considered O
that O

was O
the O
right O
thing O
to O

. O
After O
all O

the O

the O

the O

on O

The O
difficulty O
here O
arises O
from O
the O
fact O
that O
JDD S-ORG

in O

They O

that O

that O

It O
would O
not O
put O

beyond O
the O
Said B-PRECEDENT

Butt E-PRECEDENT

rule O
( O
at O
[ O
77 O
] O
) O
. O
The O
difference O
between O
that O
case O
and O
this O
is O
the O
presence O
of O
dishonesty O
here O
. O
97 O
The O
evidence O
here O
pointed O
towards O
the O
defendants O
doing O
everything O
they O
could O
to O
carry O
on O
the O
business O
of O
JDD S-ORG

normally O
so O
as O
to O
cooperate O
with O
CPH S-ORG

and O
keep O
it O
on O
board O
. O
They O
did O
put O
the O
interests O
of O
CPH S-ORG

as O
the O
potential O
new O
owner O
of O
JDD S-ORG

ahead O
of O
those O
of O
the O
plaintiff O
but O
that O
was O
because O
they O
were O
hopeful O
that O
CPH S-ORG

would O
pay O
the O
plaintiff O
off O
. O
Also O
, O
perhaps O
there O
is O
a O
distinction O
between O
defendants O
who O
act O
beyond O
their O
scope O
of O
authority O
and O
those O
who O
act O
wrongly O
within O
the O
scope O
of O
their O
authority O
. O
The O
facts O
show O
that O
the O
defendants O
here O
fall O
within O
the O
latter O
category O
as O
it O
was O
within O
their O
authority O
to O
approve O
and O
make O
payment O
of O
JDD B-ORG

various O

they O
did O
so O
wrongfully O
and O
in O
breach O
of O
JDD B-ORG

's E-ORG

obligations O
under O
the O
Debenture O
. O
The O
question O
is O
whether O
they O
can O
be O
said O
to O
have O
acted O
bona O
fide O
in O
the O
interests O
of O
JDD S-ORG

when O
they O
knew O

to O
breach O

. O
I O
have O
, O
somewhat O
reluctantly O
, O
come O
to O
the O
conclusion O
that O
on O

they O
were O
not O

I O
conclude O

that O

To O

to O

what O
is O

The O
best O
that O

that O

an O
act O

in O
which O
the O

the O
element O

Whether O

question O

by O

Whilst O
the O

it O

Mr B-LAWYER
Kumar E-LAWYER

had O
raised O
an O
argument O
in O
respect O
of O
the O
new O
calculation O
. O
He O
submitted O
that O
the O
new O
calculation O
showed O
that O
the O
Defendants O
had O
made O
an O
excess O
payment O
of O
about O
$ O
5,800 O
on O
one O
occasion O
which O
was O
applied O
by O
IFL S-PETITIONER

to O
pay O
the O
next O
interest O
payment O
due O
. O
He O
submitted O
that O
IFL S-PETITIONER

was O
not O
entitled O
to O
do O
that O
and O
should O
have O
applied O
the O
excess O
payment O
towards O
reducing O
the O
principal O
whereupon O
all O
the O
interest O
calculated O
thereafter O
would O
be O
consequently O
reduced O
and O
hence O
the O
sums O
claimed O
, O
even O
under O
the O
new O
calculation O
, O
were O
excessive O
. O
11 O
. O
Mr B-LAWYER

Lim I-LAWYER
's E-LAWYER

response O
was O
that O
the O
allegation O
of O
an O
excess O
payment O
was O
on O
the O
basis O
that O
no O
Default O
Interest O
was O
chargeable O
. O
If O
it O
was O
, O
then O
there O
was O
no O
excess O
payment O
. O
However O
, O
even O
if O
no O
Default O
Interest O
was O
chargeable O
, O
it O
did O
not O
follow O
that O
IFL S-PETITIONER

was O
obliged O
to O
apply O
the O
excess O
towards O
reducing O
the O
principal O
. O
He O
pointed O
out O
that O
under O
the O
terms O
of O
the O
term O
loan O
, O
payment O
of O
principal O
was O
not O
allowed O
unless O
certain O
conditions O
were O
complied O
with O
. O
For O
example O
, O
the O
borrowers O
had O
to O
pay O
a O
pre-payment O
fee O
and O
give O
three O
months O
' O
prior O
notice O
in O
writing O
or O
pay O
three O
months O
' O
interest O
in O
lieu O
of O
such O
notice O
. O
Furthermore O
, O
pre-payments O
had O
to O
be O
in O
multiples O
of O
$ O
100,000 O
. O
These O
terms O
applied O
to O
another O
'over-payment O
' O
as O
well O
, O
which O
he O
drew O
to O
my O
attention O
. O
12 O
. O
Upon O
hearing O
this O
submission O
, O
Mr B-LAWYER

Kumar E-LAWYER

conceded O
that O
when O
payments O
were O
made O
, O
there O
was O
no O
intention O
to O
make O
any O
capital O
pre-payment O
but O
he O
argued O
that O
this O
meant O
that O
the O
terms O
relied O
upon O
regarding O
pre-payment O
by O
Mr B-LAWYER

Lim E-LAWYER

did O
not O
apply O
. O
Notwithstanding O
this O
concession O
, O
Mr B-LAWYER

Kumar E-LAWYER

maintained O
that O
the O
excess O
should O
be O
used O
to O
reduce O
the O
principal O
. O
13 O
. O
In O
my O
view O
, O
if O
the O
Default O
Interest O
is O
not O
enforceable O
, O
and O
this O
resulted O
in O
some O
over-payments O
, O
it O
did O
not O
follow O
that O
the O
excess O
must O
be O
used O
to O
reduce O
the O
principal O
. O
Otherwise O
, O
that O
would O
be O
tantamount O
to O
effecting O
a O
capital O
pre-payment O
which O
, O
firstly O
, O
was O
never O
intended O
and O
, O
secondly O
, O
did O
not O
comply O
with O
the O
terms O
applicable O
to O
a O
capital O
pre-payment O
. O
If O
Mr B-LAWYER

Kumar E-LAWYER

was O
right O
, O
a O
borrower O
could O
easily O
circumvent O
any O
term O
on O
capital O
pre-payment O
by O
simply O
paying O
more O
than O
what O
was O
due O
, O
without O
paying O
the O
requisite O
fee O
and O
giving O
the O
requisite O
notice O
, O
or O
interest O
in O
lieu O
of O
notice O
. O
In O
my O
view O
, O
IFL S-PETITIONER

had O
already O
acted O
reasonably O
and O
correctly O
by O
applying O
the O
excess O
to O
reduce O
the O
next O
interest O
amount O
due O
in O
its O
new O
calculation O
. O
14 O
. O
However O
, O
Mr B-LAWYER

Kumar E-LAWYER

had O
raised O
another O
point O
i.e O
whether O
the O
borrowers O
should O
have O
been O
given O
interest O
on O
the O
excess O
in O
the O
interim O
. O
My O
tentative O
view O
was O
that O
they O
were O
not O
entitled O
to O
such O
interest O
and O
, O
even O
if O
they O
were O
, O
that O
was O
a O
matter O
for O
a O
counterclaim O
. O
15 O
. O
I O
would O
add O
that O
the O
arguments O
about O
the O
excess O
being O
used O
to O
reduce O
the O
principal O
or O
, O
alternatively O
, O
earning O
some O
interest O
would O
not O
have O
resulted O
in O
a O
significant O
reduction O
in O
the O
monies O
to O
be O
paid O
by O
the O
Defendants O
, O
even O
if O
either O
of O
the O
arguments O
were O
successful O
. O
It O
seemed O
to O
me O
that O
the O
strategy O
of O
the O
Defendants O
was O
simply O
to O
prevent O
or O
delay O
IFL S-PETITIONER

from O
obtaining O
judgment O
for O
any O
sum O
. O
Had O
I O
accepted O
either O
one O
of O
these O
arguments O
, O
I O
would O
nevertheless O
have O
allowed O
IFL S-PETITIONER

to O
come O
up O
with O
another O
calculation O
showing O
the O
slightly O
reduced O
sums O
as O
a O
result O
of O
the O
successful O
argument O
and O
granted O
judgment O
on O
those O
reduced O
sums O
. O
16 O
. O
In O
the O
circumstances O
, O
I O
did O
not O
rescind O
or O
vary O
my O
earlier O
order O
. O
As O
for O
the O
balance O
, O
IFL S-PETITIONER

was O
prepared O
to O
agree O
that O
the O
Defendants O
be O
granted O
unconditional O
leave O
to O
defend O
, O
and O
I O
so O
ordered O

Alleged O

no O

between O
the O

in O

the O

presently O
under O

The O
purpose O

both O

to O

if O
the O
principal O

Indeed O
the O

it O
the O
more O
necessary O
that O
the O
court O
should O
not O
interfere O

for O
here O
the O
parties O
have O
specifically O

both O
in O

the O
guarantees O
that O

. O
It O
would O
defeat O

would O
be O
out O
of O
touch O

would O
keep O
the O

waiting O
for O
a O
payment O
, O
which O
both O
the O

the O

intended O
that O
it O
should O
have O
, O
whilst O
protracted O
proceedings O

the O
alleged O

litigated O
. O
We O
do O
not O
doubt O
that O
the O

has O
a O
discretion O

it O

only O
in O

should O
the O

exercise O
its O

The O
fact O
that O
a O

which O

would O
not O

itself O
be O

out O

It O
might O
be O
that O
the O
existence O
of O
such O

coupled O
with O
cogent O
evidence O
that O
the O

would O
, O
if O

be O
unable O
to O
meet O
a O

nothing O

The O
court O
had O
no O
power O
to O
try O
such O
a O
counterclaim O
on O
such O
an O
application O
, O
but O
, O
if O
they O
thought O
it O
so O
far O
plausible O
that O
it O
was O
not O
unreasonably O
possible O
for O
it O
to O
succeed O
if O
brought O
to O
trial O
, O
it O
ought O
not O
to O
be O
excluded O
. O
If O
the O
counterclaim O
was O
for O
a O
less O
sum O
than O
that O
claimed O
, O
then O
judgment O
might O
be O
signed O
, O
if O
there O
was O
no O
real O
defence O
, O
for O
so O
much O
of O
the O
amount O
of O
the O
claim O
as O
was O
not O
covered O
by O
the O
counterclaim O
. O
But O
if O
the O
counterclaim O
overtopped O
the O
claim O
and O
was O
really O
plausible O
, O
then O
the O
rule O
which O
had O
been O
often O
acted O
upon O
at O
chambers O
, O
of O
allowing O
the O
defendants O
to O
defend O
without O
conditions O
, O
was O
the O
right O
one O
. O
There O
were O
however O
circumstances O
which O
might O
call O
on O
the O
court O
to O
act O
differently O
. O
If O
it O
was O
clear O
that O
the O
claim O
must O
succeed O
and O
there O
was O
really O
no O
defence O
to O
it O
, O
and O
the O
plaintiffs O
would O
only O
be O
put O
to O
expense O
in O
proving O
their O
claim O
, O
then O
there O
ought O
to O
be O
judgment O
on O
the O
claim O
, O
but O
the O
matter O
must O
be O
so O
dealt O
with O
that O
the O
defendants O
who O
had O
a O
plausible O
counterclaim O
must O
not O
be O
injured O
; O
and O
that O
would O
be O
done O
by O
staying O
execution O
on O
the O
judgment O
until O
the O
counterclaim O
had O
been O
tried O

The O
Court B-COURT

was O
unanimous O
in O
endorsing O
that O
the O
proper O
order O
must O
be O
for O
judgment O
to O
be O
entered O
for O
the O
plaintiffs O
, O
with O
a O
stay O
of O
execution O
pending O
trial O
of O
the O
counterclaim O
or O
further O
order O
. O
The O
reasoning O
seems O
clear O
that O
the O
claim O
by O
the O
plaintiffs O
and O
the O
counterclaim O
by O
the O
defendants O
must O
be O
taken O
separately O
. O
If O
there O
is O
no O
defence O
to O
a O
claim O
other O
than O
a O
plausible O
counterclaim O
, O
then O
judgment O
must O
be O
entered O
on O
the O
claim O

prevent O
injury O

The O

consideration O
is O
that O
if O
the O
claim O
is O
undisputed O
other O
than O
by O
means O
of O
a O

the O
claimant O
